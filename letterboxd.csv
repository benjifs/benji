This is only my second Cronenberg film which is surprising given how many times I've watched The Fly (1986). - Posted originally on: http://bnj.pw/r5Rr0"
"Tokyo!",tt0976060,3,2023-07-11,false,"Parts 1 and 3 were very interesting and different from each other while still feeling that they were about people. I'm glad I saw Holy Motors (2012) before this. I would not have wanted to see any more of &quot;Merde&quot; if this was my introduction to him. Bong Joon Ho's was my favorite of the three. - Posted originally on: http://bnj.pw/r5Rp0"

"Mission: Impossible - Fallout",tt4912910,4.5,2023-06-16,true,"Just finished rewatching the series in preparation for Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One. No matter how many times I rewatch them, it's always fun. While the first half of the series holds a special place in my heart, the second half really figured out how to build this universe and make it different than other action/spy movies. - Posted originally on: http://bnj.pw/r5RQ0"

"Mission: Impossible II",tt0120755,2,2023-06-09,true,"I dont think this one is as rewatchable as the rest so whenever I watch it I find myself rating it lower than last time. Its not bad but to me its the weakest of the series. - Posted originally on: http://bnj.pw/r5RH0"

"Forgetting Sarah Marshall",tt0800039,4.5,2023-04-15,true,"There's something about playing a movie you like for other people that makes you see things for the first time again. I loved this movie. I checked my history on letterboxd and I'm surprised that its been this long from my last rewatch to now. I put this movie on for friends because they had never seen it before and I have such good memories of this movie. This rewatch made me see more flaws and had me thinking the movie is maybe not as good as I rated it. But then any scene with the supporting cast is fun and there's a Dracula musical with puppets. There's some very real moments of a break up that are interesting in a movie like this until they are undone 10 minutes later. It's flawed but I love the memories watching this movie brings back. - Posted originally on: http://bnj.pw/r5QN0"
