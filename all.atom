		<title>How I Rate Movies</title>
		<link href="https://benji.dog/articles/how-i-rate-movies/"/>
		<updated>2023-02-15T15:00:00Z</updated>
		<summary>Trying to make sense of the way I rate movies</summary>
		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've had this post drafted for a bit and after reading <a href="https://rknight.me/no-more-ratings/">Robb Knight's post</a> about their movie rating system, I thought it's about time I finish and post it.</p>
<p>I like watching movies and I try to watch a lot of movies. For the past few years I've been using <a href="https://letterboxd.com/benji">Letterboxd</a> to track movies I watch. I didn't rate for a long time because I thought it was pointless and the rating only really applies to me but then quite a few times I found myself rewatching a movie that I had already watched because I didn't remember what I thought about it or completely forgot that I watched it.</p>
<p>The main motivation for me building a <a href="https://sparkles.sploot.com/">micropub client</a> was so that I could track my movie <a href="https://benji.dog/watched">watch</a> history on my site and move away from Letterboxd. I used to take a few days to log a movie on Letterboxd mostly out of forgetfulness but having my own client that I need to test makes me log movies sooner.</p>
<p>This rating system was created so that I could remind myself generally what I thought about the movie without having to write a review and more importantly, make it easy to know whether I thought something was worth coming back to later. It doesn't always make sense but it works for me.</p>
<p>Here's roughly how I rate movies:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>★★★ is the baseline score. This is where all movies start.</li>
<li>Every time I wish I was doing anything else, the movie drops ½.</li>
<li>★★★½ if I think the movie is worth a rewatch.</li>
<li>★★★★ is a great movie but I probably won't be coming back to it.</li>
<li>★★★★½ is great AND rewatchable.</li>
<li>★★★★★ is a perfect movie or it means something to me.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Rating something under ★★★ is rare and it doesn't speak to the quality of the film as much of whether or not it was able to interest me.</p>
<p>Fun data: 908 movies rated (Last updated 2023-02-15)</p>

<p>I'm trying to think of my site as more of a public journal where the content is for me first and if someone gets something out of it, thats just a bonus. I still dont write much because &quot;I gotta fix [x] on my site first&quot;</p>]]></content>

		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have some new changes for <a href="https://sparkles.sploot.com/">sparkles</a> but I'm struggling with the format for movie and book logs.</p>
<p><a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/h-review">h-review</a> works but if you're not adding a rating or review then it should be an <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry">h-entry</a> with a <a href="https://github.com/microformats/h-entry/issues/17">u-watch-of</a>.</p>
<p>But maybe all logs should be an <code>h-entry</code> and if theres a review it should also post an <code>h-review</code>.</p>
<p>Another issue for me with <code>h-review</code> is that it will need a tag (or category) to mark it as a movie, book, or anything else.</p>]]></content>
