			"content_html": "<p>There's a few ways to do it and I'm still trying to figure out which works best for my setup. Since Obsidian is really just reading from a local file system, you could use any number of application to sync that directory between devices. I think something like <a href=\"https://dropbox.com/\">Dropbox</a> would work but I'm thinking about going with <a href=\"https://syncthing.net/\">Syncthing</a>. The <a href=\"https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git\">Obsidian Git</a> plugin would also work but there is no mobile support. On Android this can sort of be handled with <a href=\"https://termux.com/\">Termux</a> and a cron job. The E2EE gets a little more complicated but I have this on my list of things to try:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://renerocks.ai/blog/obsidian-encrypted-github-android/\">https://renerocks.ai/blog/obsidian-encrypted-github-android/</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Overall <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">Obsidian</a> is closer to what I need but I don't want to fully move to it until I setup my own sync server that doesn't rely on their servers.</p>\n",
