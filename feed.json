			"content_html": "&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a few ways to do it and I&#39;m still trying to figure out which works best for my setup. Since Obsidian is really just reading from a local file system, you could use any number of application to sync that directory between devices. I think something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://dropbox.com/&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; would work but I&#39;m thinking about going with &lt;a href=&quot;https://syncthing.net/&quot;&gt;Syncthing&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git&quot;&gt;Obsidian Git&lt;/a&gt; plugin would also work but there is no mobile support. On Android this can sort of be handled with &lt;a href=&quot;https://termux.com/&quot;&gt;Termux&lt;/a&gt; and a cron job. The E2EE gets a little more complicated but I have this on my list of things to try:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://renerocks.ai/blog/obsidian-encrypted-github-android/&quot;&gt;https://renerocks.ai/blog/obsidian-encrypted-github-android/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n",
