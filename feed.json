			"title": "Films To Be Buried With",
			"content_text": "Being a huge movie fan, I've really enjoyed listening to the podcast Films To Be Buried With. Whenever I listen to an episode I always think I have some answers to the questions Brett Goldstein asks the guests. The basic premise of the podcast if you haven't listened to it is the following: You have died and go to heaven and people there want to know about your life through film. The following are the questions that are asked with my answers. 1. First film you remember seeing My grandmother had a laserdisc copy of Batman (1989) and while I don't remember sitting down and watching it, I do remember asking to watch it and some images here and there. My first movie theater experience I remember was Casper (1995). 2. Scariest film you've ever seen I'm not a huge fan of horror films but I have watched a few in my time. The Exorcist (1973) is amazing and I remember the whole watching experience when I was about 12 years old. While not really a horror movie, Requiem for a Dream (2000) scared me more than anything else I have ever seen. I've watched it once but I still remember every detail of that movie and even though I consider it to be a great film, I'll probably never watch it again. 3. The film that made you cry the most My wife will say I'm not a sad movie crier and instead a happy movie crier. The saddest movie I watched is probably Grave of the Fireflies (1988) but I dont remember crying. I might just not remember because of how many other emotions I had at the end of that movie. There's a lot of movies designed to make you happy cry and whatever that genre is called, I approve. The speech at the end of Jerry Maguire (1996) always gets me and even though I know its coming every time I watch this, I still can't help but tear up listening to it. 4. Critically bad film that you love I rewatch Hackers (1995) at least once a year. It has a 32% rotten tomatoes and 6.2/10 on IMDB which I've never understood. Even in the past few years I feel like there has been a larger group of people that have gone from liking the movie ironically to actually enjoying it. I watched this in '98 and have been hooked since. I think people get caught up with the way the hacking scenes are shown but even then knowing how unrealistic it was, it made sense as to why they're doing it. Typing code is visually boring and in a movie with so much flashy sets and costumes, showing a black terminal with white text while realistic would not have matched well with the rest of the aesthetic. I also miss payphones and floppy disks and there's plenty of both here. 5. Film you loved ages ago but you watched recently and it's not that great It's been a while so &quot;recently&quot; isn't entirely accurate but I think it would have to be Revenge of the Nerds (1984). This movie played consistently on TV when I was a younger and I would watch it whenever that would happen. The musical bit near the end was one of my favorite parts. It wasn't until a few years ago me and some friends found we all shared similar nostalgic feelings towards this movie so planned for a movie night and while watching it we realize just how much horrible stuff is actually happening. The 80's were weird. 6. Film with a lot of meaning to you, given the circumstances of the viewing Right after highschool but before moving to the US for university my friends and I would go to the movies weekly. Tuesdays were 2 for 1 so pretty good deal even considering the cost of movie tickets in Ecuador back then. The last movie we watched before we all moved away to different cities was Brokeback Mountain (2005). I love that movie for a million reasons but it also holds all the memories of a very specific moment in my life which I'll always cherish. 7. Sexiest film you've ever seen The obvious answer here has to be Y tu mamá también (2001). Even if you skip all the sex scenes its hard not to find the rest of the movie sexy. On top of that, to me this has one of the greatest movie endings of all time. The less obvious answer (which is also part of the questions asked in the podcast) is Chef (2014). Watch the Pasta Aglio e Olio scene and tell me I'm wrong. 8. Most relatable film This was one of the ones I knew the answer for sure and it was Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008). Its not a feeling I relate to now but for the longest I really felt a very specific way that this movie depicted fairly accurately. That was true until I watched Aftersun (2022). I don't want to get into spoilers since this is fairly new but I can see myself in both characters at different times of my life and theirs. 9. Film that made you laugh the most There wasn't a movie theater in the city I grew up in but whenever we would visit Guayaquil my mom, brother, and I went to the movies. One of these times we picked Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004). The &quot;If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball!&quot; scene caught me completely off guard and when it happened I lost it. It helps that I laugh silently so at least I wasn't annoying people but breathing is important and that was very difficult. 10. Worst film of all time A friend recommended I watch The Room (2003) as they had just been to one of the midnight shows and had loved the experience. It was pitched to me like a movie that's so bad its funny but I think it benefits from a crowd. Watching this alone on my laptop is about the saddest movie watching experience and nothing at all was funny or interesting to me. I've watched some bad movies but this one is rough. 11. Objectively best film of all time I think most answers here could be cliche and be right so mine is just an example of that. Back to the Future (1985) is a perfect movie and I don't think I even have to say anything else. 12. Film you could watch again and again My wife and I have different movie tastes but we usually try to watch The Fifth Element (1997) and Rogue One (2016) at least once a year. I think its impossible to get tired of watching The Fifth Element. Fun SciFi movie with a great cast and music and the attention to detail in the world built for it always has me feeling like I'm seeing new things for the first time. 13. Film to be buried with The Brothers Bloom (2008) could easily answer most of the other questions from above but I felt like this would be best for the end. It has a wonderful cast, magic, crime, a sibling relationship, mystery, romance, comedy, friendship. I'm sure there are many flaws with it but the good things in this movie are really good to me and I would hope sharing it through this medium might help others see it much the same way. -- That's my list. I've had this in multiple states of drafted since I talked about this over a year ago at a Homebrew Website Club meeting and I'm happy I've finally finished it.",

			"title": "How I Rate Movies",
			"content_text": "I've had this post drafted for a bit and after reading Robb Knight's post about their movie rating system, I thought it's about time I finish and post it. I like watching movies and I try to watch a lot of movies. For the past few years I've been using Letterboxd to track movies I watch. I didn't rate for a long time because I thought it was pointless and the rating only really applies to me but then quite a few times I found myself rewatching a movie that I had already watched because I didn't remember what I thought about it or completely forgot that I watched it. The main motivation for me building a micropub client was so that I could track my movie watch history on my site and move away from Letterboxd. I used to take a few days to log a movie on Letterboxd mostly out of forgetfulness but having my own client that I need to test makes me log movies sooner. This rating system was created so that I could remind myself generally what I thought about the movie without having to write a review and more importantly, make it easy to know whether I thought something was worth coming back to later. It doesn't always make sense but it works for me. Here's roughly how I rate movies: ★★★ is the baseline score. This is where all movies start. Every time I wish I was doing anything else, the movie drops ½. ★★★½ if I think the movie is worth a rewatch. ★★★★ is a great movie but I probably won't be coming back to it. ★★★★½ is great AND rewatchable. ★★★★★ is a perfect movie or it means something to me. Rating something under ★★★ is rare and it doesn't speak to the quality of the film as much of whether or not it was able to interest me. Fun data: 908 movies rated (Last updated 2023-02-15) rating count ½ 1 ★ 5 ★½ 8 ★★ 24 ★★½ 46 ★★★ 163 ★★★½ 179 ★★★★ 250 ★★★★½ 129 ★★★★★ 103",

Still, I thought it would be fun to try and recap what happened and what I did in 2022. Personal A (wife), O (kid), and I have been in our house for 2 years now. This year also marks our house's 100th year from when it was built which is ridiculous to even think about. There's a lot of cool info I was able to find in public library records about the house including some pictures of it from a long time ago. We've had friends and family visit us this past year which has been nice as travelling with a toddler by plane still feels very scary to me. We have a list of places where we think would be a good place to travel with O but haven't settled on anything yet. Code I took on a few more responsibilities at work including the backend of some of the applications I work with. I hadn't looked at Java code in a bit but it felt quite natural coming back to it after all these years. Outside of work duties I have been working a little more on some personal projects. The big thing I worked on this year was a micropub client called sparkles. This was a project I had started, trashed, and restarted a few times but was committed to getting it to some state of completeness this year. I also did some minor changes to my micropub endpoint. I keep debating naming this something but haven't quite decided what to do there. One last project that I started working on was an indieauth and token endpoint to switch away from indieauth.com. I keep hearing about plans to possibly deprecate IndieAuth and this also seems like the next logical step of IndieWeb related projects for me to work on. Movies I miss going to the movies but I'm still very cautious with indoor spaces where others are unmasked. I only saw three movies in theaters this year but hoping that changes in 2023. This year I watched 138 movies (100 new and 38 rewatched). That's 5 less movies than 2021 but 22 more new movies watched. Favorites: Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022) Aftersun (2022) TV I don't add episodes watched here but I do actively track everything I've watched on trakt. The Office is somehow always on TV so whenever A and I don't have anything to watch and O is asleep, that goes on. There's also a lot of Bluey. A few favorites from this year: Andor The Bear Our Flag Means Death Reservation Dogs The Resort Rewatched Halt and Catch Fire Station Eleven Ted Lasso Music I moved from Spotify to Apple Music earlier this year. One of the biggest things that I've missed is access to Spotify's Discover Weekly which makes finding music from new artists harder now. Apple's alternative has not figured me out yet or is just not even close to Spotify's. Favorite new releases: Skinny Ape - Gorillaz Contraluz - Joliette Time Skiffs - Animal Collective Wet Leg - Wet Leg Pool Kids - Pool Kids And In The Darkness, Hearts Aglow - Weyes Blood I've also been enjoying figuring out what sort of stuff O likes to listen to. Whenever he reacts to music we save it and replay it later and if he reacts positvely multiple times, we add it to his playlist: Music of Oz We haven't added anything new in a bit because he's currently in a Gorillaz only phase. I'm not complaining. Read I also haven't figured out how I want these posted on my site but I went back through what I've read and thought I'd add them here for now.

			"content_text": "Update (2022-12-13): Did some cleanup to the code so I'm feeling ok about making this public now. Code is available here: https://github.com/benjifs/sparkles I've been working on a micropub client on and off for a few months now and since its IndieWeb Gift Calendar season, I figured it was the perfect time to write about it. tl;dr: sparkles is a micropub client. It supports IndieAuth for login and expects a micropub endpoint to communicate with to publish posts. It supports basic micropub content types and you can also add movies you have watched. Motivation I wrote a micropub and media endpoint sometime in 2020 and since then I've been using several micropub clients to post content to my site. There are some extensions I would have liked to add to those but I felt like they were so specific to how I want to publish content to my site that it wouldn't have made sense to add there. I could have also just built the specific additions I wanted but I took this as an opportunity to build the one micropub client I would like to use. Development Similar to my micropub endpoint, I wanted to build this so it could easily be deployed to Netlify with a single click and some minor environment variable configurations. I initially tried to keep things as close to vanilla JS as possible but in the end chose to use Mithril.js as a framework. I already use several of the other popular Javascript frameworks in other projects so I took this as an opportunity to learn something new. CORS errors started showing up and the quickest way I figured at the time to handle these errors was to use Netlify's functions to proxy requests to the IndieAuth and micropub endpoints. There is probably a better way to handle this but I figured this could be future Benji's problem. The Actual App On login there are options to add content based on the basic content types. Clicking on notes for example will open up a basic textarea and an input field for comma separated tags. One of the custom content types that I wanted to support on my site is watched movie posts. I currently manually run some code to convert my RSS feed from Letterboxd and it works well enough but ideally this could all be done directly to my site using micropub. For movie search I am using OMDb API which gives me all the basic info I would want to display for a movie. After a movie is selected, you can select if you have rewatched it and whether or not to rate it. The last bit of features I wanted to add where all dependent on sparkles being a Progressive Web App (PWA). With the website installed on my phone as a PWA I could now share content from other apps to sparkles which will let me create a &quot;reply&quot;, &quot;bookmark&quot;, &quot;like&quot;, or &quot;RSVP&quot; post. Lastly, I can also create a quick note or add an image using the shortcuts option. Issues PWA support is sort of iffy in my experience. I think Safari on iOS doesn't have full support for shortcuts or share_target which I think makes sense since these are still marked experimental. On Android, only Chrome or Samsung Browser on Samsung devices seem to have access to a WebAPK minting server which is necessary for the full PWA experience. While the website can still be added as a shortcut, it will lose those key features if its not installed with a browser that supports PWAs. Future plans The code for sparkles is still not open source but once I get stuff cleaned up I plan to make it public now on GitHub. I don't usually write out reviews for movies so I completely forgot to include that when building the movie editor out. I plan to add an optional textarea with a checkbox to mark whether or not the content itself contains a spoiler. The other type of content that I wanted to be able to publish from here are recipes. I have the basic idea for how to structure them but I'm still in the early planning stages on how to handle the different parts of a recipe. I also have to add support for this type of post on my micropub endpoint first which is why I'm leaving all of this for later.",
