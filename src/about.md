## whoami
Born in [Guayaquil, Ecuador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guayaquil) ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¨ and now living in [Minneapolis, MN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis). I primarily work as a native Android and iOS developer but also spend some time doing frontend and backend development.

## icon

<div class="img-block text-center">
	<img src="/assets/icons/favicon-96x96.png" alt="benji.dog avatar" loading="lazy">
</div>

I wanted a favicon and this is the best I could come up with. It's meant to read "benji" in [Elian Script](https://ccelian.com/ElianScriptFull.html).

I also made an 88x31 icon:
<div class="img-block text-center">
	<img style="min-height: 31px" src="/assets/88x31.png" alt="benji.dog 88x31 icon" loading="lazy">
</div>
