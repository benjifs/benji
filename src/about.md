## whoami
Born in [Guayaquil, Ecuador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guayaquil) ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¨ and now living in [Minneapolis, MN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis). I primarily work as a native Android and iOS developer but also spend some time doing frontend and backend development.

## icon

![benji.dog avatar](/assets/icons/favicon-96x96.png)

I wanted a favicon and this is the best I could come up with. It's meant to read "benji" in [Elian Script](https://ccelian.com/ElianScriptFull.html).

I also made an 88x31 icon [![benji.dog 88x31 icon](/assets/88x31.png)](https://benji.dog)
