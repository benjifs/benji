I sort of do this with a webring I run that generates an OPML file: [1.44MB](https://1.44mb.club) ([source](https://github.com/benjifs/1.44MB)). You could also look into how [blogofthe.day](https://blogofthe.day/) ([source](https://github.com/artlung/blogofthe.day/)) does it as that uses [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and builds an RSS feed. I'm happy to help if you need more info.
