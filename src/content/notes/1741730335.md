I imported my (outdated) [watchlist](/watchlist) from Letterboxd and will start adding stuff here from now on. I used the following [node.js script](https://www.benji.dog/code/watchlist/) to parse my exported watchlist `.csv` and grab data from themoviedb to have more options on what to display there.
