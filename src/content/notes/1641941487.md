There's a few ways to do it and I'm still trying to figure out which works best for my setup. Since Obsidian is really just reading from a local file system, you could use any number of application to sync that directory between devices. I think something like [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com/) would work but I'm thinking about going with [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/). The [Obsidian Git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git) plugin would also work but there is no mobile support. On Android this can sort of be handled with [Termux](https://termux.com/) and a cron job. The E2EE gets a little more complicated but I have this on my list of things to try:
