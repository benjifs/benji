I'm not sure who's also using my [micropub endpoint](https://github.com/benjifs/micropub) implementation but I've been thinking about doing a major refactor for it.

My plan is to finally split it up into different libraries and finally stop the need to fork the full repo to run it for yourself.

This might be my goal for this years [IndieWeb Gift Calendar](https://indieweb.org/2023-12-indieweb-gift-calendar).
