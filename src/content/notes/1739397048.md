> This is a draft

I spent a lot of time with my grandma growing up and she would have strong black coffee three times a day. I dont quite remember what it tasted like but I remember everyone commenting on how strong she liked her coffee. I would sit with her in the kitchen as she would scoop out some instant coffee, pour hot water, and take a [rosca](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o91PL4X2xng) for herself and one for me. Once or twice (or thrice) I had a sip of her coffee and remember loving it even as a *too* young kid. I probably didnt actually start drinking coffee until my early teens but back then, it was almost always instant.

Once I moved to the US, nothing really changed. I had instant coffee at home and that's most of what I drank unless I was having coffee out with friends which was usually whatever was brewed. At some point I was gifted a [moka pot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot) and through a lot of trial and error, learned to make coffee in this. I still had instant available, but there was something about the ritual of the moka pot that I enjoyed at the time.

At some point the moka pot was damaged so I took that opportunity to learn a different brewing method. I tried a french press but the ritual from the moka pot wasn't there so I got an [Aeropress](https://aeropress.com/) to try out different recipes and techniques. This was most of the coffee I drank. But I still had instant coffee when I had to rush.

Several pour overs, cold brews, and espressos later we are here. I have 2-3 cups of coffee a day and they are usually either cold brew or a milky espresso drink with some bad latte art I make at home.

I like a cold brew from [Caribou](https://www.cariboucoffee.com/) or [Workhorse](https://www.workhorsecoffee.com/), a mocha from [Dogwood](https://www.dogwoodcoffee.com/), or whatever sweet drink Starbucks has. I order a [cortado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortado) if I'm trying a new place. But there's always instant at home.

Whenever I'm in a rush or I miss home, I have some instant coffee and things are a little better.
