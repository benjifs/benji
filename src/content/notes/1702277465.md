I completely agree with this. A big challenge for me has been finding the right example that is _maybe_ linked in the wiki. When nothing is found I usually ask at HWC and get more pieces of the puzzle but in cases where something isn't defined as well as other things, like watch posts, it's a dead end.

This is specially important in this case. When there's not an example anywhere it's up to the person that wants to define the microformats to do it. For me it's a bit intimidating and I have struggled with this because I don't think I understand enough and sometimes do it completely wrong.

Luckily like you mentioned in your [reply to gRegor](https://sarajaksa.eu/2023/12/reply-to-gregors-reply-to-my-post-the-chicken-egg-problem-of-movie-microformats/), people I've interacted with in the IndieWeb have always been very helpful and I have not felt judgement for being wrong. But I don't know if this would be immediately apparent to a newcomer.
