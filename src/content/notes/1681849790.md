Things have been quiet over here but I did recently make some changes to my [watched](/watched) page. You can click on a star rating to view the list of movies that fall into that rating (for example: [★★★](/watched/rated/3)).

Now that I have most of the features to track my movie watches on here I might try to get access to the [Letterboxd API](https://letterboxd.com/api-beta/) so that I can [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) to there.
