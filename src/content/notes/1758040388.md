I think I have all the pieces set up and [Umbrella](https://umbrella.sploot.com) is ready to go. It is a simple [11ty](https://11ty.dev) starter site that has [IndieAuth](https://github.com/benjifs/serverless-indieauth), [Micropub](https://github.com/benjifs/serverless-micropub), and [Webmentions](https://github.com/benjifs/serverless-webmentions) built in using [Netlify functions](https://docs.netlify.com/build/functions/overview/).

I've been using all of these pieces on my site for a bit but I wanted to put them all together in one place just in case it could help others start their own site.
