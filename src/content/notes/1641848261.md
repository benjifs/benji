I've been struggling with the same. I like [Notion](https://notion.so) but I don't think the mobile experience works as well as it does on desktop. [Trilium](https://github.com/zadam/trilium) is the easiest to setup but I the UX makes it harder to work with than Notion for me. Overall [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is closer to what I need but I don't want to fully move to it until I setup my own sync server that doesn't rely on their servers.
