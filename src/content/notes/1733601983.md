To celebrate [IndieWebCamp: San Diego 2024](https://events.indieweb.org/2024/12/indiewebcamp-san-diego-2024-7C9aq9A4Zv9m) I want to send you a sticker.

![IndieWeb in heavy metal font](/uploads/1733600236_20241118_130822.jpg)

I got these stickers [printed](https://stickerninja.com) after [Nick Simson](https://nicksimson.com) got these commissioned from a discussion we had at a past Homebrew Website Club.

If you want one of these, you can [email me](mailto:{{metadata.author.email}}?subject=Re:Stickers) your mailing address and I'll ship one out to you. I'll try to send these anywhere in the world [USPS](https://usps.com) will let me but if for any reason that's not possible, I'll let your know.
