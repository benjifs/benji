Just in case you're looking for an approach for fetching webmentions every so often using Github Actions, this is what I do: [fetch_webmentions.yml](https://github.com/benjifs/benji/blob/main/.github/workflows/fetch_webmentions.yml)

I like to store the webmentions in my repo just in case something happens to webmention.io but it's not really necessary.
