I brought it up again at [HWC Pacific](https://events.indieweb.org/2023/12/homebrew-website-club-pacific-WpVST8egsuVr) since its one of the main ways I use my site and the lack of consensus has always bothered me.

I create [watch posts](https://indieweb.org/watch) with [sparkles](https://sparkles.sploot.com) where the `u-watch-of` property is an `h-cite` with name, year, IMDB ID, and IMDB URL. I also add a `rating` and `progress` which can be "want", "started", or "finished" based on these [discussions](https://github.com/microformats/h-entry/issues/17#issuecomment-505807276).

In the [watched](/watched) feed they used to be `h-review`s but was pointed to this [discussion](https://github.com/microformats/h-entry/issues/32) about switching over to `h-entry` with an `u-review-of` at HWC. Not 100% on board but it feels better than `h-review`.

If we take [RSVP](https://indieweb.org/rsvp)s as an example where a `in-reply-to` and `rsvp` means its an RSVP post, it would seem like an `h-entry` with a `p-rating` is enough to classify a post as an review. This way we could review a `u-watch-of`, `u-read-of`, or anything else. I think there might be a conflict if a post where to have a `u-watch-of` and a separate property (location for example) where the question would be: Is this review of the movie, the venue, or seeing the movie at this venue.

For now, this is how I'm using watch posts. I need to start adding some of this stuff to the wiki and other discussions since it feels like if someone were to want to add `watch` posts they could either use this as a starting point or tell me how it can be improved.
