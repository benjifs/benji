I've fully moved to my new [webmention receiver](https://github.com/benjifs/serverless-webmentions). Similar to my [micropub endpoint](https://github.com/benjifs/micropub), it is setup to run with Netlify functions so it is ✨serverless✨. If you'd like to help me test it, please send a webmention so I can fix what's broken.
