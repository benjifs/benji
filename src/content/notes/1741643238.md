      Postcard designed by Jo picturing a person with long hair and glasses
      using a computer that reads 'I <3 the web' on the screen. Below there is
      the cover of Zachary's zine 'Gardening Growth'. To the right there are two
      stickers picturing a gray cat balancing a coffee cup on its head, James'
      website mascot.
