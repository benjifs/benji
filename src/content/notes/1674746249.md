I have some new changes for [sparkles](https://sparkles.sploot.com) but I'm struggling with the format for movie and book logs.

[h-review](http://microformats.org/wiki/h-review) works but if you're not adding a rating or review then it should be an [h-entry](http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry) with a [u-watch-of](https://github.com/microformats/h-entry/issues/17).

But maybe all logs should be an `h-entry` and if theres a review it should also post an `h-review`.

Another issue for me with `h-review` is that it will need a tag (or category) to mark it as a movie, book, or anything else.
