Ever since I left twitter and reddit I havent been able to follow discussions related to the new Star Wars shows which is why I appreciate your episode reviews.

I'm liking the show so far, specially because Ep5 was so different than what we're used to in Star Wars in general. I'm really excited to find out what happened to the Coven and also to hopefully get more background on "The Stranger".
