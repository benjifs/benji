I made a zine the other day so that I could have a physical copy of [Nemik's Manifesto](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_Trail_of_Political_Consciousness) from the Star Wars TV show: [Andor](https://www.starwars.com/series/andor).

You can [read it, print a copy, and share with others](https://benji.dog/the-trail-of-political-consciousness) if you'd like.
