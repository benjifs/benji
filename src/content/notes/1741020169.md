I finally had some time and released the feeds for [IndieWeb Carnival](https://iwcarnival.sploot.com/) and [IndieWeb Movie Club](https://iwmovieclub.sploot.com/). It uses [Bridgy Fed](https://fed.brid.gy) to post to Fediverse and Bluesky but you can also follow the RSS feed. I'll make the code public once I get a chance to clean some stuff up and document the setup a little better.
