I've seen some people use either `~/code`, `~/projects`, or `~/programming`. The first IDE I used was [Eclipse](https://eclipseide.org/) and by default it would create projects under `~/workspace`. Since then I've been using that as my source code directory but also because its a small reference to [Hackers (1995)](https://imdb.com/title/tt0113243/).
