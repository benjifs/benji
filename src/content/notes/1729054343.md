Even though I have some search engines setup in Firefox, I never realized the keyword column was a shortcut. I should have probably read the description.

I do like and heavily use [DuckDuckGos !Bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/). It pretty much does the same thing but without needing to set things up as long as the "bang" is already added to their list. And since DDG is my default search engine, it means I can do something like:

- <kbd>CMD</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> to focus address bar
- chicken !indieweb

Some of my most used bangs are: `!w`, `!wes`, `!g`, `!m`, `!tmdb`
