I need to find a better git workflow for posts. Currently posts published through my [micropub endpoint](https://github.com/benjifs/micropub) are pushed to a branch. That branch gets automatically deployed to preview on Netlify. On a push to `main`, a GitHub Action deploys to "production". I manually deploy changes when a post is made after I've previewed and "approved" them but doing a PR for all of these seems like overkill but that might be the way to go for now.
