Back home in Ecuador I don't remember anyone drinking tea unless it was for medicinal purposes (stomach ache, nausea, cold). We do coffee multiple times a day, and I still usually drink a cup of coffee right before bed.

Tea culture in the UK was always fascinating to me so a few years ago I spent some time trying to learn how to make a proper cup of tea. I'm not sure if I got there but I sometimes will have my version of that as a treat.
