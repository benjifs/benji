I'm not sure if this is a thing but [Joe](https://artlung.com/) and I must have shared a dream last night.

> Friendship is funny. Itâ€™s so vital to us. But it can be brittle. Fragile.

Moving around a lot I got used to having temporary friends. I've lost touch with a lot of people and have tried to reconnect to little success. There's nobody to blame, we're all different now.

I like the metaphor of friendship as a garden because it feels very true. I like gardens. I like to see stuff grow and enjoy things when they're ready. But I'm bad at gardening. I hope I can be better.
