After 5 years, I (finally) updated my [micropub endpoint](https://github.com/benjifs/micropub). It should be a little easier to deploy and configure which would hopefully make it possible for more people that use static site generators to use a micropub endpoint. Check out [serverless-micropub](https://github.com/benjifs/serverless-micropub) for a working example.
