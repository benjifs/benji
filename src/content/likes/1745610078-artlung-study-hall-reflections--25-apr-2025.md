So many important points here but I take this one to heart:

> If your page is doing what you want it to, thatâ€™s already a win!

[Front End Study Hall](https://indieweb.org/Front_End_Study_Hall) is a great time and I encourage everyone to attend.

Congrats on a year of FrESH [Joe](https://artlung.com)!
