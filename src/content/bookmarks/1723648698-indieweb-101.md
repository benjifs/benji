This is a great intro post to the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org). I've seen many discussions about it in the past about whether the microformats and webmentions are needed to be a part of the *IndieWeb*.

My personal opinion is **no** but the lines get blurry between the IndieWeb, the Independent Web, smolweb, etc.

I just want everyone to have a website.
