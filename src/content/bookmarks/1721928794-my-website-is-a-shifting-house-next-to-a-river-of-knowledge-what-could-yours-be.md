I don't quite know what my website is. Sometimes I think of it like a shelf. I wish it was closer to a garden.

Realistically, it's more of an attic. I add things to it so that if I ever need them, they're there. But its dark and could do with a good cleaning. There may also be some bugs crawling around.
