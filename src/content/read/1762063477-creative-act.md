*This post is my entry for October's [IndieWeb Book Club](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Book_Club) hosted by [Zachary Kai](https://zacharykai.net/). This month's book is [The Creative Act by Rick Rubin](https://zacharykai.net/notes/iwboct25).*

I'm not sure I would've picked up this book had it not been prompted by this book club. Even though I like nonfiction, this book sort of lacks a narrative and I think I would've felt like it would be harder to get into.

When I started reading it I felt like a lot of these thoughts and ideas were things I agreed with. But, as silly as this may sound, at some point I realized this book wasn't talking to a generic reader. I was supposed to be taking these ideas for myself.

I have done some sort of art in different versions all through my life but I have never considered myself an artist. For whatever reason, I only apply this to myself as I consider anyone else that does art, in whatever form that may be, an artist. This book made me start thinking of this framing and what may be the actual cause for it.

There's something about my own drawings or music that I may just be too critical of. There was this quote that I highlighted:

<q>Doubting yourself can lead to a sense of hopelessness, of not being inherently fit to take on the task at hand. All or nothing thinking is a nonstarter.

However, doubting the quality of your work might, at times, help to improve it. You can doubt your way to excellence.</q>

And I realized that's part of what my block is. **Excellence** seems unachievable for my current skills. But I think that's the point this book is trying to make. Making art is about the *making* of the art.

<q>All that matters is that you are making something you love, to the best of your ability, here and now.</q>

I don't usually write book reviews or comments. I'm not sure what keeps me from doing it but I'm hoping this book club will motivate me to put some more of my thoughts down in the future.

Thanks Zachary for hosting and restarting this book club!
