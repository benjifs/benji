    In 1978, CBS aired the “Star Wars Holiday Special” the week before
    Thanksgiving to an audience of 13 million people. Considered one of the
    worst shows in television history, it aired only once. George Lucas tried to
    bury it and an infamous camp legend was born. This documentary unravels the
    mysteries behind the most bizarre Star Wars spin-offs of all time.
