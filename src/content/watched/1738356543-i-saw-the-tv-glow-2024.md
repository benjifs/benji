I like movies that believe in themselves this much and go out of their way to shoot things a specific way, or do slam poetry in the middle, or toe the line of horror where the ideas are scarier than the visuals.

I liked this movie a lot, but it made me sad.

Read [Jo's review](https://dead.garden/blog/i-saw-the-tv-glow.html) as it articulates all of the good parts of this movie better than I can.
