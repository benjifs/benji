        Charlie's got a 'job' to do. Having just left prison he finds one of his
        friends has attempted a high-risk job in Torino, Italy, right under the
        nose of the mafia. Charlie's friend doesn't get very far, so Charlie
        takes over the 'job'. Using three Mini Coopers, a couple of Jaguars, and
        a bus, he hopes to bring Torino to a standstill, steal a fortune in gold
        and escape in the chaos.
