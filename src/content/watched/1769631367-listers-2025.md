I keep jumping back and forth on my rating and thoughts. I'm fascinated that they were able to do as much as they did with the estimated budget of $15,000 USD. Even though I wasn't always a fan of the main subjects of the documentary, I appreciate their commitment.

I still recommend watching this if you are not interested in birdwatching.
