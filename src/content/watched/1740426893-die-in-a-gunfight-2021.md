        Mary and Ben are the star-crossed black sheep of two powerful families
        engaged in a centuries-long feud. When the pair reignite a romance after
        many years apart, their forbidden love draws a motley assortment of
        schemers and killers into their orbit, and as fists and bullets fly, it
        becomes clear that violent delights will have violent ends.

This is *not* my entry for this months [IndieWeb Movie Club](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Movie_Club).

Person: "This is my line"
Person 2: "Punchline"
Me: **groan**

I've never used the word *cringe* but I can find no other word that matches what this film is trying to do. Some scenes look pretty but that wasn't enough for me.
