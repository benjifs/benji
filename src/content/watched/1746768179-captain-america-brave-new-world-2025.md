It was fine? I enjoyed the show more.

This is a Captain America movie and it should focus on him more. I know it's the theme of these movies now but the MCU seems to be focus on the grand storyline rather than the characters.

Anthony Mackie is doing great and I hope his next MCU film let's him do more.
