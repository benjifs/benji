        A group of friends graduates from the halls of Georgetown University
        into lives that revolve around sex and career aspirations. Kirby waits
        tables to pay for law school. His roommate Kevin struggles at a D.C.
        newspaper as he searches for the meaning of love. Jules may be an object
        of adoration and envy, but secretly she has problems of her own. Demure
        Wendy is in love with Billy—a loveable sax player and an irresponsible
        drunk. Alec wants it all: a career in politics and the appearance of a
        traditional home life. Alec’s girlfriend, Leslie, is an ambitious
        architect who doesn't know about his infidelity, but his new allegiance
        to the Republican Party is already enough to put her off marriage.

The last third of the movie is better than the first two but that's still not great. [Andie MacDowell](https://imdb.com/name/nm0000510/) is probably the only reason I don't rate this lower.
