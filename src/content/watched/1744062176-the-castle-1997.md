*This post is my entry for [IndieWeb Movie Club #008](https://zacharykai.net/notes/iwmapr25).*

Here's another new to me movie thanks to [IndieWeb Movie Club](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Movie_Club). The movie poster made me think it would be a bit more 80s comedy and while this is a funny film, its a different *vibe*.

Spoiler warning: <spoiler>I was a little worried that the film would end with them losing the land but get a big payout that would make it possible for them to relocate the castle. I think I just expected the judges to side with the airline and this would have given them a happy-ish ending. I was actually surprised and enjoyed them winning in the end.</spoiler>

This one is going *straight to the pool room*.
