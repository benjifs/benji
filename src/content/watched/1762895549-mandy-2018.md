I was planning to do Nicvember where I would try to watch a Nicolas Cage movie every day of the month. That's not going to happen.

When I was thinking about Nicvember, I decided to start with something I hadn't seen before and because several people I trust had recommended this one, I thought why not.

Oh boy!

I'm not sure what I think of this one to be honest. It's too slow for making it super rewatchable, even after ignoring all of the tragedy and gore. At the same time, it reminded me a lot of the video game series [Hotline Miami](https://hotlinemiami.com/), stylistically more than story-wise.

Of course the thing that more than anything makes this movie stand out is Nic Cage's performance. I'm not sure any other actor could have had a better take in the bathroom scene.

The more I think about it as I'm writing this review, the more I want to rewatch it. But that's for later.
