        Marcel is an adorable one-inch-tall shell who ekes out a colorful
        existence with his grandmother Connie and their pet lint, Alan. Once
        part of a sprawling community of shells, they now live alone as the sole
        survivors of a mysterious tragedy. But when a documentary filmmaker
        discovers them amongst the clutter of his Airbnb, the short film he
        posts online brings Marcel millions of passionate fans, as well as
        unprecedented dangers and a new hope at finding his long-lost family.

Marcel is such a wonderful character. It's such a lovely story.

Minor spoiler below:

<spoiler>There's a point where Marcel is reaching out to people for help and instead of helping, they use this as an opportunity to take selfies.<br><br>Marcel's realization is that <i>"It's still a group of people, but it's an audience. It's not a community."</i><br><br>There's a lot of thoughtful observations in this movie but this one stuck with me because of how isolating the internet can still feel even when we're more connected now than we have ever been before.</spoiler>
