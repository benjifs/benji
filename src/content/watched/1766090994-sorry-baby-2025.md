    Agnes feels stuck. Unlike her best friend, Lydie, who’s moved to New York
    and is now expecting a baby, Agnes still lives in the New England house they
    once shared as graduate students, now working as a professor at her alma
    mater. A ‘bad thing’ happened to Agnes a few years ago and, since then,
    despite her best efforts, life hasn’t gotten back on track.

This is one of those films that deals with a very difficult topic in a different way than other films. There's a lot of standout moments here but the scene with the sandwich really got to me.

I wouldn't recommend you watch it without checking the synopsis first though.
