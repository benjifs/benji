After reading Kottke's post [In Praise of Comfort Films](https://kottke.org/25/10/in-praise-of-comfort-films) I decided to revisit an old favorite.

I was lucky to watch this before it's release with the actors present for a Q&A afterwards. By lucky, I mean MySpace had an event where you had to put the movie's page as part of your **Top 8**, print your profile, and line up to get in.

If I'm watching for flaws both in the characters and use of language, then there are plenty. But watching this film reminds me of waiting in line with my brother to watch a movie we knew nothing about with a fun soundtrack and hijinks in NYC. The romance plot I could take or leave.

I am starting to realize that "hijinks in NYC" might be up there as one of my favorite subgenres.

My comfort films are usually that because it reminds me of a specific moment in time and I need to remember to revisit these more often than I do.
