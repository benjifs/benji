I'm happy I got to watch this so close after watching [MI: Dead Reckoning](/watched/1747546413-mission-impossible---dead-reckoning-part-one-2023/). This film just puts the previous one in a weird spot since, other than introducing two characters and the evil AI, you could skip "Part One" and still get most of the plot with just this film.

I did hear that people had issues with all the explaining and flashbacks but I actually liked that since it makes the film quite standalone. I watched this with someone that had never seen a Mission Impossible film and she got the gist. I still believe that you could cut parts one and two into a single film in 2.5hr and still have a pretty great film rather than two OK films.

<spoiler>I honestly thought Ethan would die in the end but when he didn't, I hoped he would at least go dark and fake his death. He's done it all, saved the world a million times, and lost his family. He should rest now. I'm sad it didn't really end there.</spoiler>

<spoiler>I also wish Pom Klementieff had more to do. Her prison fight scene is so great and then basically nothing.</spoiler>

<spoiler>Finally, learning about what William Donloe has been up to since the first film was truly great.</spoiler>
