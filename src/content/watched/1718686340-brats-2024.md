        In the 1980s, Andrew McCarthy was part of a young generation of actors
        who were set to take over Hollywood after a string of successful teen
        movies. However, when the New York magazine cover story in 1985 dubs
        them the Brat Pack, stars in the making suddenly find themselves losing
        control over the trajectory of their careers. Now, almost forty years
        later, McCarthy looks to reconnect with peers and co-stars so that
        together they can reflect on their respective legacies.

I don't know what story this is telling. I might finally watch [St. Elmo's Fire](https://themoviedb.org/movie/11557) though.
