    When young priest Jud Duplenticy is sent to assist charismatic firebrand
    Monsignor Jefferson Wicks, it’s clear that all is not well in the pews.
    After a sudden and seemingly impossible murder rocks the town, the lack of
    an obvious suspect prompts local police chief Geraldine Scott to join forces
    with renowned detective Benoit Blanc to unravel a mystery that defies all
    logic.

Even though it felt like the majority of the cast was barely on screen, the moments that they were on were really great. [Josh O'Connor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_O%27Connor) continues to surprise me and gives such a wonderfully moving performance in this film.

Spoilers: <spoiler>The unexpected Phantom of the Opera really made me laugh out loud.</spoiler>
