Just finished rewatching the series in preparation for [Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One](https://imdb.com/title/tt9603212/).

No matter how many times I rewatch them, it's always fun. While the first half of the series holds a special place in my heart, the second half really figured out how to build this universe and make it different than other action/spy movies.
