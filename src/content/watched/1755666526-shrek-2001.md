    It ain't easy bein' green -- especially if you're a likable (albeit smelly)
    ogre named Shrek. On a mission to retrieve a gorgeous princess from the
    clutches of a fire-breathing dragon, Shrek teams up with an unlikely
    compatriot -- a wisecracking donkey.

We just watched this last month but they were showing this in theaters so it felt like a great opportunity to see this on the big screen with [O](/tags/o) and [F](/tags/f). It went pretty well for a first movie theater experience for both of them.
