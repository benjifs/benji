This was the only movie of the [saga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_films) that I had not seen in theaters.

I almost cried when [Hayden Christensen](https://themoviedb.org/person/17244) showed up on screen to intro the [20th Anniversary release](https://www.starwars.com/news/revenge-of-the-sith-20th-anniversary-theatrical-release).
