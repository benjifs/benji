        In director Baz Luhrmann's contemporary take on William Shakespeare's
        classic tragedy, the Montagues and Capulets have moved their ongoing
        feud to the sweltering suburb of Verona Beach, where Romeo and Juliet
        fall in love and secretly wed. Though the film is visually modern, the
        bard's dialogue remains.

This is *not* my entry for this months [IndieWeb Movie Club](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Movie_Club).

First time rewatching this in 25 years. I remember it being a lot more like the first 20 minutes than it was, which is maybe why my rating isnt higher.

Also don't remember the soundtrack being this good but I was also a kid that did not become aware of Prince or Radiohead until much later than this.
