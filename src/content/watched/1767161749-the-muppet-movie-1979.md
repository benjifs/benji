    The Muppets gather to watch their newly-finished big-budget rich-and-famous
    feature film: a talent agent persuades Kermit the Frog to leave the swamp to
    pursue a career in Hollywood. On his way there, he meets a bear, a pig, a
    whatever (his future muppet crew), and some special celebrity guest stars,
    while being chased by the desperate owner of a frog-leg restaurant!
