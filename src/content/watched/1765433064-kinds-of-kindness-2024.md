My favorite [Yorgos Lanthimos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorgos_Lanthimos) movies are co-written with [Efthymis Filippou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efthimis_Filippou).

I liked the multiple chapters in this film but I wish each of these were full length to get some more out of these specific characters. But at the same time, each chapter had just enough to keep me thinking about them for a long while.
