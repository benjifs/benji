    Nemo, an adventurous young clownfish, is unexpectedly taken from his Great
    Barrier Reef home to a dentist's office aquarium. It's up to his worrisome
    father Marlin and a friendly but forgetful fish Dory to bring Nemo home --
    meeting vegetarian sharks, surfer dude turtles, hypnotic jellyfish, hungry
    seagulls, and more along the way.
