*This post is my entry for this month's [IndieWeb Movie Club](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Movie_Club) hosted by [Zachary Kai](https://zacharykai.net/notes/iwmsep25).*

It has not been that long since I last [watched this film](/watched/1733512008-the-wild-robot-2024/) but I still remember quite a bit of it. I'm biased because any parental themes in movies is sure to get me to like it. Add to that [found family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chosen_family) themes and beautiful animation and I'm all in.

While most of the film is pretty formulaic, it still managed to surprise me in quite a few different ways. The whole sequence of Roz arriving and encountering the critters was just as funny the second time around. Pinktail might also be my favorite character but I love that all the forest dwellers have their own unique personalities even when they are relatively minor parts.

I appreciate that the film ends with Roz getting picked up after realizing that they would come back. It makes that last scene with Roz and Brightbill so much more meaningful while also ending in a way that if they didn't make sequels feels ok.

<q>Negative. That gosling stalks me, emits noise, and makes simple tasks more complicated or impossible.</q>
