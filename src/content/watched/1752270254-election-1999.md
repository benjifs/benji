        Tracy Flick is running unopposed for this year’s high school student
        election. But Jim McAllister has a different plan. Partly to establish a
        more democratic election, and partly to satisfy some deep personal anger
        toward Tracy, Jim talks football player Paul Metzler to run for
        president as well.
