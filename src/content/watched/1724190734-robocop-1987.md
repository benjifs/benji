        In a violent, near-apocalyptic Detroit, evil corporation Omni Consumer
        Products wins a contract from the city government to privatize the
        police force. To test their crime-eradicating cyborgs, the company leads
        street cop Alex Murphy into an armed confrontation with crime lord
        Boddicker so they can use his body to support their untested RoboCop
        prototype. But when RoboCop learns of the company's nefarious plans, he
        turns on his masters.

I've been meaning to rewatch this for a while and since I heard some positive things about the [RoboDoc](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5759360/) documentary, this seemed like the perfect time.

I know this movie is huge and considered a classic but I am surprised that it's not even bigger than that.
