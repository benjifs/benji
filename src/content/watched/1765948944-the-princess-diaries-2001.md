    A socially awkward but very bright 15-year-old girl being raised by a single
    mom discovers that she is the princess of a small European country because
    of the recent death of her long-absent father, who, unknown to her, was the
    crown prince of Genovia. She must make a choice between continuing the life
    of a San Francisco teen or stepping up to the throne.
