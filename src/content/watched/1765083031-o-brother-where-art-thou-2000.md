No matter how many times I stumbled unto this movie on TV, I actually never watched it. I'm not sure what it was but it just never seemed interesting to me. I also didn't know that the soundtrack for this film was massively popular after this film came out.

I finally sat down to watch it and I'm honestly glad I didn't watch it before. I may have not given what this film is doing the credit it deserves. I will probably come back to it in the future soon as I believe it would benefit from a few rewatches to catch things I may have missed the first time.

A few quotes I wrote down while watching it mostly because of the delivery:

<q>Well ain't this place a geographical oddity! Two weeks from everywhere!</q>

<q>I guess I'm the only one that remains unaffiliated.</q>

<q>Lots of respectable people have been hit by trains.</q>
