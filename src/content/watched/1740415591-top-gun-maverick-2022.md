        After more than thirty years of service as one of the Navy’s top
        aviators, and dodging the advancement in rank that would ground him,
        Pete “Maverick” Mitchell finds himself training a detachment of TOP GUN
        graduates for a specialized mission the likes of which no living pilot
        has ever seen.

You know what, this movie is amazing! I'm just not a fan of Miles Teller which is probably why I rated this lower on my [first watch](/watched/1671775200-top-gun-maverick-2022/).
