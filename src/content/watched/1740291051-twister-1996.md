        An unprecedented series of violent tornadoes is sweeping across
        Oklahoma. Tornado chasers, headed by Dr. Jo Harding, attempt to release
        a groundbreaking device that will allow them to track them and create a
        more advanced warning system. They are joined by Jo's soon to be
        ex-husband Bill, a former tornado chaser himself, and his girlfriend
        Melissa.

Accidentally ended up rewatching this and still pretty good. It makes me feel like I was a little harsh on [Twisters](/watched/1724028647-twisters-2024/).
