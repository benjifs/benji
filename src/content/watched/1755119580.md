I think this quote sums it up pretty well:

<q>I wish we could do that whole trip all over again. We'd be a little more deliberate this time. Drive a little slower, take our time. Take a good look at stuff.</q>

For an under 90 minute movie, this really builds a world and you learn so much about the characters. It's truly a wonderful film.
