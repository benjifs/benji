I had never heard of this film before [Joe](https://artlung.com) recommended it in the [IndieWeb Chat](https://chat.indieweb.org) sometime last year. I promptly watched it as I realized I had not seen many films starring [Barbra Streisand](https://barbrastreisand.com) and I felt I had to fix that.

The first time I watched it I found myself playing close attention to the plot and the bags. I wanted to follow what everyone was doing and how exactly they would resolve it. This time I ignored the plot to focus more on the jokes. There were so many little reactions and background sounds that I completely missed the first time.

Sometimes knowing where the joke ends makes the joke even funnier. As soon as Fritz (not Hans) tells the other guy to stop Mrs Van Hoskins with his "charm", it all played once in my head and again on screen. This happened again with the chase sequence. And as soon as the judge showed up, I officially could not stop laughing just remembering his lines and delivery.

Thanks [Joe](https://artlung.com) for hosting this month's [IndieWeb Movie Club](https://indieweb.org/indieweb-movie-club) as well as for recommending this originally.
