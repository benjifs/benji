I like that this movie didn't waste too much time explaining the backstory of every single character. This is something that even [Captain America: Brave New World](/watched/1746768179-captain-america-brave-new-world-2025/) did recently which I did not enjoy.

On paper, I should love [David Harbour](https://themoviedb.org/person/35029)'s character but it was one joke too many for me.
