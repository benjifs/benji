The [Fingernails](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/790459-fingernails) plot doesn't really work here. It also doesn't really work without it otherwise we're just watching two people cheat.

The ending was good but I wish they would've added a little more to the [Black Mirror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror) subplot or find a way to make the movie without it.
