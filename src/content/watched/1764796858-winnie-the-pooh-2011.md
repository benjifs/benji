    During an ordinary day in Hundred Acre Wood, Winnie the Pooh sets out to
    find some honey. Misinterpreting a note from Christopher Robin, Owl
    convinces Pooh, Tigger, Rabbit, Piglet, Kanga, Roo, and Eeyore that their
    young friend has been captured by a creature named "Backson" and they set
    out to rescue him.
