        After high school slacker Ferris Bueller successfully fakes an illness
        in order to skip school for the day, he goes on a series of adventures
        throughout Chicago with his girlfriend Sloane and best friend Cameron,
        all the while trying to outwit his wily school principal and fed-up
        sister.
