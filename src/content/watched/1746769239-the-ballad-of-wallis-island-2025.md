        Eccentric lottery winner Charles lives alone on a remote island but
        dreams of hiring his favourite musician, Herb McGwyer, to play an
        exclusive, private gig. Unbeknownst to Herb, Charles has also hired
        Herb’s ex-bandmate and ex-girlfriend, Nell, with her new husband in tow,
        to perform the old favourites. As tempers flare and old tensions
        resurface, the stormy weather traps them all on the island and Charles
        desperately looks for a way to salvage his dream gig.

Oh boy. I was not ready for this today.

Spoiler warning: <spoiler>There was a great moment where <a href="https://themoviedb.org/person/550396">Akemnji Ndifornyen</a>'s character has words with one of the leads. It's such a refreshing moment in what in a worse film would've led to a much different outcome.</spoiler>
