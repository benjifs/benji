    Finding himself in a new era, and approaching retirement, Indy wrestles with
    fitting into a world that seems to have outgrown him. But as the tentacles
    of an all-too-familiar evil return in the form of an old rival, Indy must
    don his hat and pick up his whip once more to make sure an ancient and
    powerful artifact doesn't fall into the wrong hands.

I finally got around to watching this one and I enjoyed it so much. If it was a few minutes shorter, I think it could've been a little better for me.
