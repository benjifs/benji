Apparently I've [watched this before](https://letterboxd.com/benji/film/mad-max/). I have no recollection of doing so and after watching it, I get it.

The first 20 minutes are pretty great. Then I just kept trying to follow what was happening. I was lost by the end of it.

It definitely was hurt by how much I like [Fury Road](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/76341-mad-max-fury-road) and [Furiosa](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/786892-furiosa-a-mad-max-saga) which is unfair on my part.
