Parts 1 and 3 were very interesting and different from each other while still feeling that they were about people.

I'm glad I saw [Holy Motors (2012)](/watched/1679431369-holy-motors-2012) before this. I would not have wanted to see any more of "Merde" if this was my introduction to him.

[Bong Joon Ho](https://imdb.com/name/nm0094435/)'s was my favorite of the three.
