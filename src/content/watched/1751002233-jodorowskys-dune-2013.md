        Shot in France, England, Switzerland and the United States, this
        documentary covers director Alejandro Jodorowsky (El Topo, Holy
        Mountain, Santa Sangre) and his 1974 Quixotic attempt to adapt the
        seminal sci-fi novel Dune into a feature film. After spending 2 years
        and millions of dollars, the massive undertaking eventually fell apart,
        but the artists Jodorowsky assembled for the legendary project continued
        to work together. This group of artists, or his “warriors” as Jodorowsky
        named them, went on to define modern sci-fi cinema with such films as
        Alien, Blade Runner, Star Wars and Total Recall.

I'm unsure if this film is trying to tell us Jodorowsky is a genius or a fool. Regardless, he built one amazing team. It would be great to see the full book released or actually adapted to a comic or animation project.
