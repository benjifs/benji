There's something about playing a movie you like for other people that makes you see things for the first time again.

I loved this movie. I checked my history on [letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/benji/film/forgetting-sarah-marshall/activity/) and I'm surprised that its been this long from my last rewatch to now.

I put this movie on for friends because they had never seen it before and I have such good memories of this movie. This rewatch made me see more flaws and had me thinking the movie is maybe not as good as I rated it.

But then any scene with the supporting cast is fun and there's a Dracula musical with puppets. There's some very real moments of a break up that are interesting in a movie like this until they are undone 10 minutes later.

It's flawed but I love the memories watching this movie brings back.
