Not sure when I'll watch part 2 but I couldnt remember the plot of this one so I thought I was due a rewatch.

I think its still a fun action movie with some very Mission Impossible moments. In the end it feels like its missing something and doesnt quite work for me as a standalone film.

Maybe someone will do an edit that combines pt1 and 2 into something less than 2.5 hours.
