    Prominent gang leader Cyrus calls a meeting of New York's gangs to set aside
    their turf wars and take over the city. At the meeting, a rival leader kills
    Cyrus, but a Coney Island gang called the Warriors is wrongly blamed for
    Cyrus' death. Before you know it, the cops and every gangbanger in town is
    hot on the Warriors' trail.

A friend was telling me about this movie and it made it such a fun watch with the added context and perspective from a fan.
