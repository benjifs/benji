I really hope they continue making these and adapt the rest of the books. I'm excited to read them in the meantime.

The art direction that DreamWorks is going between this and [Puss in Boots: The Last Wish](https://www.benji.dog/watched/1677563688-puss-in-boots-the-last-wish-2022/) is great and I hope they continue this even with their other projects.
