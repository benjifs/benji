<i>This post is my entry for <a href="https://jamesg.blog/2024/10/02/movie-club-oct-2024/">IndieWeb Movie Club #003</a>.</i>

This movie is so interesting as I've probably watched it more as clips and references in all other sorts of media than actually sat down to watch it. I think this is the only time I've actually sat down and chosen it to watch, rather than it just playing on TV.

I had a hard time not thinking about the plot of [Wicked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_(musical)) and how all those pieces fit together. It helps to give the Wicked Witch of the West more background as in this film she's just a "bad witch". For me, Wicked is canon.

I'm keeping to my same format for this one since it's so late in the month, but I might switch to something different for the next one.

- **First viewing**: I remember it was playing on TV and I actually sat down to watch the whole thing in early 2007.
- **Watch count**: 2 times all the way through. Hundreds of times if we count every single time I've seen it in parts.
- **Favorite quote**: <q>As Coroner I must aver, I thoroughly examined her, and she's not only merely dead, she's really most sincerely dead.</q>
- **Favorite scene**: The obvious one is when Dorothy walks out the door in to Oz and the screen just fills with color. Yeah, there's something technologically amazing about this but the thing that stands out to me the most is the complexity of that set. There's so much detail that went in to every piece, prop, and costume. This still happens but in a much more naturalistic way so as to not see the seams. But the seams are good.
- **Prop I wish I had**: The Scarecrow's diploma. Just because out of all of the things the Lion, the Scarecrow, and the Tin Man get, this one is the silliest to me.
- **Best boy**[*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_boy): [Terry](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1206094/) who plays Toto. She's my favorite.

At close to 100 years, this film is unlike anything else. Yes, there's brilliance on screen but just as important, or even more so, is the horrible conditions and treatment people were subjected to in the making of this film. I don't think the extent of health complications potentially caused by the filming of this can even be documented. Toxic paint, asbestos snow, diets, and drugs is just a few of them and that's just for physical health. The list is extensive and [Craig](https://mrdizzyblog.neocities.org/blog/wizard-of-oz/) already has discussed some of them so I encourage you to check it out. I also really enjoyed this [video essay by Kaz Rowe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhlrndJ1Hz8) where they discuss a lot of these topics too.

I'd be curious to read more about this era of Hollywood and what all had to go down to get the rules and safeguards to protect all people involved. It's still not perfect as there are several cases in recent years of more people harmed by those in power, but the egregiousness of that time is something I hope has long gone.

Still, this movie's legacy will probably go on longer than any of us and audiences that are not even born yet will continue to experience it.

One thing I found interesting is that there is a direct yet subtle theme that connects all entries in the [IndieWeb Movie Club](https://indieweb.org/indieweb-movie-club) so far (see [#001](https://www.benji.dog/watched/1724730246-the-matrix-1999/) and [#002](https://www.benji.dog/watched/1725858009-when-harry-met-sally-1989/)). All of these movies have so far contained a message about the importance of friendship and/or found family. Because you don't always have to do things alone.
