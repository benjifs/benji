*This post is my entry for this months [IndieWeb Movie Club](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Movie_Club) hosted by [Tantek](https://tantek.com/2025/120/t1/indieweb-movie-club-tomorrowland).*

There's a moment where Hugh Laurie's character is talking about the state of things and how people are taking the message that is supposed to make them scared and instead "repackaging" it.

<q>It can be enjoyed as video games, as TV shows, books, movies. The entire world wholeheartedly embraced the apocalypse and sprinted towards it with gleeful abandon.</q>

I liked some of what this movie is trying to say. I really liked how this movie looks. But the overall message feels more bleak than optimistic given pretty much everything.

Maybe I missed the part where they explain how people in "Tomorrowland" talk about how they are helping the other dimension? What is the purpose of invention and research without obstruction if the advancements in technology are kept to themselves without benefiting the rest.

It's not helped by the fact that it ends where it begins. Recruiting even more "dreamers" which will continue to improve their world while failing to help the rest.

I've read about and watched my fair share of Disney history, from the [parks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Experiences) to [Walt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney) so I appreciated the trivia. I even found myself pointing at the screen and saying "I understood that reference" more than once.

<q>It's not personal. It's just programming.</q>
