    It has been nine years since we last met Jesse and Celine, the
    French-American couple who once met on a train in Vienna. They now live in
    Paris with twin daughters but have spent a summer in Greece at the
    invitation of an author colleague of Jesse's. When the vacation is over and
    Jesse must send his teenage son off to the States, he begins to question his
    life decisions, and his relationship with Celine is at risk.
