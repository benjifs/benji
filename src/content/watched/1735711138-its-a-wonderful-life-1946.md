*This post is my entry for [IndieWeb Movie Club #005](https://marksuth.dev/posts/2024/12/indieweb-movie-club-december-2024-its-a-wonderful-life-1946).*

Honestly, I wasn't sure what to expect. I have somehow made it 30+ years without watching it and assumed all the praise would have made it impossible to live up to.

I was wrong.

The beauty of this movie is the timelessness of it. Not only does it hold up after almost 80 years but it also feels like it could be watched at any point of the year and the message would still carry through. I dont know if I would even consider it a Christmas movie as I originally believed it was. [Die Hard](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/562-die-hard) meets that criteria better than this film does.

I initially felt a little underwhelmed by the fact that Potter never really had a turn or consequences to his story. The more I thought about it the more I realized that sometimes, much like in real life, people with that amount of control dont actually grow. They also may not lose, but they do fail.

Because in the end, the message of the movie is very explicitly told to us:

<q>Remember no man is a failure who has friends.</q>

Finally, just because this helped me visualize the amount in 2024: $8000 is $129433.
