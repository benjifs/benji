    As storm season intensifies, the paths of former storm chaser Kate Carter
    and reckless social-media superstar Tyler Owens collide when terrifying
    phenomena never seen before are unleashed. The pair and their competing
    teams find themselves squarely in the paths of multiple storm systems
    converging over central Oklahoma in the fight of their lives.
