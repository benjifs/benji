I wanted this to say a bit more and in terms of documentaries its maybe not as thorough as it could be. Worth checking out the [Defunctland  Jim Henson videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLplWWKocAfTYIGzH8eQ0x0kEQgoV9CpYm) for a little more insight into the shows and the people involved.
