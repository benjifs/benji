    At her 25th high school reunion, Peggy Sue faints and awakens in 1960—back
    in her senior year, before her marriage and all her regrets. Given a second
    chance to relive her youth, she must decide whether to change the choices
    that shaped her life or embrace the past that made her who she is.
