        Gromit’s concern that Wallace is becoming too dependent on his
        inventions proves justified, when Wallace invents a “smart” gnome that
        seems to develop a mind of its own. When it emerges that a vengeful
        figure from the past might be masterminding things, it falls to Gromit
        to battle sinister forces and save his master… or Wallace may never be
        able to invent again!
