*This post is my entry for this month's [IndieWeb Movie Club](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Movie_Club) hosted by [Thomas](https://vanderwal.net/random/entrysel.php?blog=2128).*

All movies are magical in their own way. Whether it's the idealistic world view that they present, the wonderful characters that bring the story to life, the amazing locations that you can't help but wonder if they are real or not, the actual magical beings shown, or just the fact that almost against all odds a set of artists got together to do their art for everyone else to enjoy.

Somehow, [Local Hero](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/11235-local-hero) does all of the above. It's a very quiet movie that before Mac arrives in Scotland you sort of feel like you know how things will play out. But as soon as [Peter Capaldi](https://www.themoviedb.org/person/12982-peter-capaldi)'s character gets introduced, things feel a little different.

This film breaks all expectations time and time again. I would even argue that it does not really follow the traditional [three-act structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-act_structure) nor does it really have an antagonist. Instead we get to explore [Ferness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Hero_(film)#Filming) with Mac and slowly through meeting the locals, and being welcomed as one of their own, fall in love with a different way of life.

For me this is such an interesting example of [magical realism in film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_realism#Film_and_television) which I was surprised to find out this film ~~is~~ was not even listed there.

The ending is left open ended and it falls to us to think of who could the call be from. I'd like to believe that it's Mac calling to check in on his friends. I hope that the Mac gets a chance to go back. Maybe even live there.

But seriously:

<q>Whose baby?</q>
