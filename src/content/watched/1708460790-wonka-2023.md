I only know Willy Wonka from when it gets referenced in other media as I've never fully watched the [Gene Wilder](https://imdb.com/title/tt0067992/) or [Tim Burton](https://imdb.com/title/tt0367594/) films. If this is what they're like, I get it. I can imagine watching this as a kid and just loving the world and the characters.
