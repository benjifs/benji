    In 1979 Clive Sinclair, British inventor of the pocket calculator,
    frustrated by the lack of home investment in his project,the electric car,
    also opposes former assistant Chris Curry's belief that he can successfully
    market a micro-chip for a home computer. A parting of the ways sees Curry,
    in partnership with the Austrian Hermann Hauser and using whizz kid
    Cambridge students, set up his own, rival firm to Sinclair Radionics, Acorn.
    Acorn beat Sinclair to a lucrative contract supplying the BBC with machines
    for a computer series. From here on it is a battle for supremacy to gain the
    upper hand in the domestic market.

This came up in a recent conversation about [Halt and Catch Fire](https://thetvdb.com/series/halt-and-catch-fire) and I know it also previously came up in a [Homebrew Website Club](https://events.indieweb.org/) so I finally watched it. I think I expected to learn more about the actual machines since I have no actual connection to any of this hardware.

The most interesting part to me was the final news report that summarizes the state of the companies and the wikipedia rabbit hole I went down afterwards.
