    Charlie Kaufman is a confused L.A. screenwriter overwhelmed by feelings of
    inadequacy, sexual frustration, self-loathing, and by the screenwriting
    ambitions of his freeloading twin brother Donald. While struggling to adapt
    "The Orchid Thief," by Susan Orlean, Kaufman's life spins from pathetic to
    bizarre. The lives of Kaufman, Orlean's book, become strangely intertwined
    as each one's search for passion collides with the others'.

It's hard not to compare this to [Synecdoche, New York (2008)](/watched/1655424000-synecdoche-new-york-2008/) as they obviously cover some of the same ideas of art and artists.

The performances here are amazing for the whole cast and it's maybe Nic Cage's best.
