        Nine years later, Jesse travels across Europe giving readings from a
        book he wrote about the night he spent in Vienna with Celine. After his
        reading in Paris, Celine finds him, and they spend part of the day
        together before Jesse has to again leave for a flight. They are both in
        relationships now, and Jesse has a son, but as their strong feelings for
        each other start to return, both confess a longing for more.
