*This post was supposed to be my entry for December's [IndieWeb Movie Club](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Movie_Club) hosted by [Dr. Matt Lee](https://status.lol/mattl/693857e8292e1).*

I still haven't read the [graphic novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_World_(comics)) that this is based on but that was my original plan.

I'm curious whether the ambiguity and almost fantastical parts are present in the book. If so, do those themes play a bigger part? I kinda wish they did.

<q>I used to think about one day, just not telling anyone, and going off to some random place. And I'd just... disappear. And they'd never see me again. Did you ever think about stuff like that?</q>
