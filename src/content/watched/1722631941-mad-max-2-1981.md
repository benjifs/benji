        Max Rockatansky returns as the heroic loner who drives the dusty roads
        of a postapocalyptic Australian Outback in an unending search for
        gasoline. Arrayed against him and the other scraggly defendants of a
        fuel-depot encampment are the bizarre warriors commanded by the
        charismatic Lord Humungus, a violent leader whose scruples are as barren
        as the surrounding landscape.

Now this I enjoyed a bunch. It feels more in world than [Mad Max](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/9659-mad-max).

I read a little about the making of these two films and it's very interesting to learn more about the background of the people involved and how these actually got made. The final car flip at the end of this one feels impossible.
