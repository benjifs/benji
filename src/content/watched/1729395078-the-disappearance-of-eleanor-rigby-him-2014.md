This review is for this movie and [The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby: Her](/watched/1729395301-the-disappearance-of-eleanor-rigby-her-2014/).

Its hard to rate these separately and rating "Them" seems misleading as I believe watching both is what makes them great.

"Him" is a breakup movie without context for us.

"Her" feels less structured as you slowly gather the pieces necessary to see more of the story.

Not having all the pieces is what makes each of these films more interesting. And while watching both may answer some questions, it is in no way a full picture. I really like not knowing the rest.

Prepare for heartbreak.
