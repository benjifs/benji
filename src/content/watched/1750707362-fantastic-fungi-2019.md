    A vivid journey into the mysterious subterranean world of mycelium and its
    fruit— the mushroom. A story that begins 3.5 billion years ago, fungi makes
    the soil that supports life, connecting vast systems of roots from plants
    and trees all over the planet, like an underground Internet.  Through the
    eyes of renowned mycologist Paul Stamets, professor of forest ecology
    Suzanne Simard, best selling author Michael Pollan, food naturalist Eugenia
    Bone and others, we experience the power, beauty and complexity of the fungi
    kingdom.

I think I get what this is trying to say but I don't like the way it says it. I also did not like the need to anthropomorphize mushrooms with the narrator as this felt like it was trying to do.
