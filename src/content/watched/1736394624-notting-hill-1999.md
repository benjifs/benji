    William Thacker is a London bookstore owner whose humdrum existence is

    in his shop. A chance encounter over spilled orange juice leads to a kiss
    that blossoms into a full-blown affair. As the average bloke and glamorous
    movie star draw closer and closer together, they struggle to reconcile their
    radically different lifestyles in the name of love.

You would think I would've really liked this movie. The cute parts were real cute. It's just hard to believe the first kiss.

Everything with the friend group was great and I would've enjoyed that a lot more.
