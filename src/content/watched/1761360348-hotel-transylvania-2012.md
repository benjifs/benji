    Welcome to Hotel Transylvania, Dracula's lavish five-stake resort, where
    monsters and their families can live it up and no humans are allowed. One
    special weekend, Dracula has invited all his best friends to celebrate his
    beloved daughter Mavis's 118th birthday. For Dracula catering to all of
    these legendary monsters is no problem but the party really starts when one
    ordinary guy stumbles into the hotel and changes everything!

Wasnt expecting much but was actually pleasantly surprised. There were a bunch of real funny and memorable moments.

Not sure if we'll watch the sequels but we might rewatch this really soon.
