    Several generations following Caesar's reign, apes – now the dominant
    species – live harmoniously while humans have been reduced to living in the
    shadows. As a new tyrannical ape leader builds his empire, one young ape
    undertakes a harrowing journey that will cause him to question all he's
    known about the past and to make choices that will define a future for apes
    and humans alike.

I liked it but I'm not a fan of the human subplot. Are these people responsible for the events that lead to [Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/1685-beneath-the-planet-of-the-apes)?
