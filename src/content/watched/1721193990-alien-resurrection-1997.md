It wasn't as bad as I expected based on all the negative stuff I'd heard about it before.

Spoilers:
<spoiler>I didn't really like the design of the newborn but the fact that the creature emotes so much in its final scene was very impressive. For a second, you really feel for them as they look at Ripley.</spoiler>
