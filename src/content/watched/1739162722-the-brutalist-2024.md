This is technically ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️, but it leaves one or two things too open to interpretation that I find it hard to rate it that. It's the kinda film that will stay with you long after you see it.

I'm happy I saw this in a theater and the 3h35m runtime was barely felt. There is a 15min intermission which was a nice break as it splits the two parts rather nicely.
