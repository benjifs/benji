        One night in his near-empty tower block in contemporary London, Adam has
        a chance encounter with a mysterious neighbor Harry, which punctures the
        rhythm of his everyday life. As a relationship develops between them,
        Adam is preoccupied with memories of the past and finds himself drawn
        back to the suburban town where he grew up, and the childhood home where
        his parents appear to be living, just as they were on the day they died,
        30 years before.

I was prepared to cry. I was expecting it to be about a certain kind of loss but it was much more than that.

It is about grief and throughout you grieve with [Andrew Scott](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0778831/)'s character so that eventually, hopefully, there is some acceptance.

Perfect use of [Always On My Mind - Pet Shop Boys](https://song.link/us/i/696889916)
