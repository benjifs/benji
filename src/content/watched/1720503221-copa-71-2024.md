    The extraordinary story of the 1971 Women’s World Cup, which was held in
    Mexico City and witnessed by more than 100,000 fans. This landmark
    tournament was dismissed by FIFA and written out of sports history – until
    now, with dazzling archival footage and interviews with the former players.

110,000 people attended this World Cup final and I had never heard about it before.

This was about the event and not the players but I still wish we learned a bit more about them and what happened after the final.
