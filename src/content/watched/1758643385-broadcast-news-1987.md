    Basket-case network news producer Jane Craig falls for new reporter Tom
    Grunnick, a pretty boy who represents the trend towards entertainment news
    she despises. Aaron Altman, a talented but plain correspondent, carries an
    unrequited torch for Jane. Sparks fly between the three as the network
    prepares for big changes, and both the news and Jane must decide between
    style and substance.

I liked the ending but then I found that there was an [alternate ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9c80HWTcsM) and was amazed that a film could have two great endings to choose from that completely change the story.

The film did lose me a bit at the reveal of the manufactured moment in the interview and how that could be a relationship defining moment. Then I thought more that this may be due to my own skepticism that anything I see in media, news or otherwise, is manufactured. Which made me realize how accurate [Albert Brooks](https://www.themoviedb.org/person/13-albert-brooks)' monologue near the end was.
