        At 14, best friends Robb Reiner and Lips made a pact to rock together
        forever. Their band, Anvil, hailed as the "demi-gods of Canadian metal"
        influenced a musical generation that includes Metallica, Slayer, and
        Anthrax. Following a calamitous European tour, Lips and Robb, now in
        their fifties, set off to record their 13th album in one last attempt to
        fulfill their boyhood dreams.

This was recommended in a podcast and I thought I'd give it a try. I've been slowly getting into band documentaries so why not.

Having never heard them before, for the first few minutes I kept wondering whether this was real or a mockumentary. Some of the stuff that was happening just came out of nowhere and seemed heavily staged to follow a narrative.

They do have some good riffs.
