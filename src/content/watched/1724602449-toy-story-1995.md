        Led by Woody, Andy's toys live happily in his room until Andy's birthday
        brings Buzz Lightyear onto the scene. Afraid of losing his place in
        Andy's heart, Woody plots against Buzz. But when circumstances separate
        Buzz and Woody from their owner, the duo eventually learns to put aside
