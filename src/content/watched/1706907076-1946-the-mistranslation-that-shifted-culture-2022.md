I saw that [gRegor](https://gregorlove.com/2024/01/watched-1946/) watched this and I was very curious. I really enjoyed the historical parts but felt some of the personal dynamics were not necessary as they're just there to show that even with evidence and facts, some people just wont change their mind.
