I remember watching this when it came out having no context for the series other than [Alien](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/348-alien). After watching it as part of a rewatch of the series in preparation for [Alien: Romulus](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/945961-alien-romulus), this one might be close to my favorite.

I didn't get why it was divisive at the time and I still don't quite understand.
