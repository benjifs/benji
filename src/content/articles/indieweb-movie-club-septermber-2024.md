Mark announced the [beginning of IndieWeb Movie Club last month](https://marksuth.dev/posts/2024/07/indieweb-movie-club) and selected [The Matrix (1999)](https://marksuth.dev/posts/2024/08/indieweb-movie-club-august-2024-the-matrix-1999) as the first movie to watch. I loved the idea of a Movie Club as well as any excuse to [rewatch The Matrix](https://www.benji.dog/watched/1724730246-the-matrix-1999/).

Since I decided to volunteer as a host for this month, I thought I needed to pick a movie with an Autumn theme as September is the beginning of that season (in the Northern Hemisphere). [When Harry Met Sally... (1989)](https://themoviedb.org/movie/639) was the first thing that I thought off. I haven't seen this movie in a long time but I'm hoping that the Autumn theme is obvious in the movie but even if it isn't, the [poster](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/3wkbKeowUp1Zpkw1KkBqMWbt0P9.jpg) for this movie alone is **very** Autumn.

To participate in the movie club, write a post about your thoughts on this movie and post it on your site. Optionally, you can [email me](mailto:{{ metadata.author.email }}) a link to your post and I will add it to a roundup post at the end of this month. You can also reply to this post via [webmention](https://indieweb.org/Webmention).

**Everyone is welcome to join this movie club.**
