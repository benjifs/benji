Since this is doing the rounds again, I figured it was a good time to update my defaults app for the end of 2024. I have noted where the changes happened but you can also check out my [defaults for 2023](/articles/defaults-2023/) to compare for yourself.

I do also keep a [/uses](/uses) page which is what I keep up to date as things are changing.
