I've seen quite a few people posting their app defaults [inspired by Hemispheric Views 097 - Duel of the Defaults!](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097). It's always fun to go over these because I like to find new apps and services to try out and sometimes it ends up being my default too.

I keep a list of apps and other things I [use](/uses) but thought this would be nice to look back to next year as a snapshot of what apps I was using in 2023.

I also recommend checking the [list of default apps others are using](https://defaults.rknight.me) maintained by [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me/).
