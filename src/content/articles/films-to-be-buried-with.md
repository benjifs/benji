Being a huge movie fan, I've really enjoyed listening to the amazing podcast [Films To Be Buried With](https://play.acast.com/s/filmstobeburiedwith). I have wanted to figure out what my answers to the questions [Brett Goldstein](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2073429/) asks the guests for a while so here it is:

The basic premise of the podcast if you haven't listened to it is the following: You have died and go to heaven and people there want to know about your life through film.

## 1. First film you remember seeing
My grandmother had a laserdisc copy of Batman (1989) and while I don't remember sitting down and watching it, I do remember asking to watch it and some images here and there. My first movie theater experience I remember is Casper (1995).

## 2. Scariest film you've ever seen
I'm not a huge fan of horror films but I have watched a few in my time. The Exorcist is amazing and I remember the whole watching experience when I was about 12 years old. While not really a horror movie, Requiem for a dream scared me more than anything else I have ever seen. I've watched it once but I still remember every detail of that movie and even though I consider it to be a great film, I'll probably never watch it again.

## 3. The film that made you cry the most
My wife will say I'm not a sad movie crier and instead a happy movie crier. Tom Cruise's speech at the end of Jerry Maguire will always get me and I recently rewatched The Holiday since my wife had never seen it and there's a scene near the end with one of the non lead characters that also made me cry. (LOOK INTO SPOILER TAGS)

## 4. Critically bad film that you love
I rewatch Hackers (1995) at least once a year. It has a 32% rotten tomatoes and 6.3/10 on IMDB. I don't 

## 5. Film you loved ages ago but you watched recently and it's not that great

## 6. Film with a lot of meaning to you, given the circumstances of the viewing

## 7. Sexiest film you've ever seen

## 8. Most relatable film
