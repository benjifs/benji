September has come and gone and so had another [IndieWeb Movie Club](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Movie_Club). I was very excited to host this month's movie club and am looking forward to host more of these in the future. [When Harry Met Sally... (1989)](https://themoviedb.org/movie/639) might have been a slight change of pace from [September's Movie Club](https://marksuth.dev/posts/2024/09/indieweb-movie-club-august-2024-round-up-the-matrix) but this to me is the exciting thing about this movie club. It's like a box of chocolates. Wait, that's a different movie.

October's Movie Club is hosted by [James](https://jamesg.blog/) where the movie to watch is [The Wizard of Oz (1939)](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/630).

## Submissions

[Sara](https://sarajaksa.eu/2024/09/indieweb-movie-club-september-2024-when-harry-met-sally-when-romance-destroyed-freindship/) discusses the harmful messages this movie uses as it's central thesis and lists several pieces of media where the same romance genre can portray similar ideas without needing to fall into stereotypical messages. There's a lot of good recommendations here so it's definitely worth checking them out.

Thanks Sara!

[Antonio](https://antonio.is/2024/09/22/indieweb-movie-club-when-harry-met-sally/) is a big fan of romcoms so his appreciation for the movie comes through in his post. The connection about loneliness in a big city was something that once I read him point out, I could not unsee.

Thanks for your post Antonio.

[Paolo](https://www.feadin.eu/en/posts/when_harry_met_sally___/)'s post covers some details about the making of the film and how much of real life was put into it. They also consider the original ending and how it would have affected the whole experience. I agree fully with Paolo here and wish this was an alternate version we could see.

Lovely post Paolo.
