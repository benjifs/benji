This is my second time doing [December Adventure](https://eli.li/december-adventure). I had a lot of fun with this
last year even though I didn't write something every day. I'm expecting a bit of the same this year but that's ok as I believe that's the point.

		<h2>2025-12-01</h2>
		<h3>Day 1</h3>
		<p>Today is just for setup which is easy as I'm reusing this calendar and layout from <a href="/articles/december-adventure-2024">last year</a> since I still really like how this looks.</p>
	</article>
	<article id="day-2">
		<h2>2025-12-02</h2>
		<h3>Day 2</h3>
		<p>Snow has started here again which means it's time to <i>make it snow</i>. If you need assistance, call <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QacpBRPonzM">Mr. Plow</a>.</p>
	</article>
	<article id="day-3">
		<h2>2025-12-03</h2>
		<h3>Day 3</h3>
		<p>Nothing really to show today. I've been reworking my <a href="https://neovim.io/">neovim</a> config as I'm switching to a new computer soon. This is pretty much the only time I revist my <a href="https://github.com/benjifs/dotfiles">dotfiles</a>.</p>
	</article>
	<article id="day-4">
		<h2>2025-12-04</h2>
		<h3>Day 4</h3>
		<p>Nothing probably for the next few days. Our schedule at home is changing so gotta figure that out first.</p>
	</article>
	<article id="day-7">
		<h2>2025-12-07</h2>
		<h3>Day 7</h3>
		<p>I didn't really do any code today, but I have been working on setting up my new (to me) phone. I finally have a device that supports <a href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a> so I'm going to try this out first.</p>
	</article>
	<article id="day-8">
		<h2>2025-12-08</h2>
		<h3>Day 8</h3>
		<p>Setting up the new phone has been fun but it's also made me realize how many apps on Android rely on Play Services for notifications. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libby_(service)">Libby</a>, for example, does not know what to do when I try to manage notifications and the UI just freezes until I force stop the application. The <a href="https://www.fotmob.com/">FotMob</a> app does have a nice troubleshooting feature where it tells me specifically what the issue is. I wish more apps had a way to debug and also test notifications.</p>
	</article>
	<article id="day-9">
		<h2>2025-12-09</h2>
		<h3>Day 9</h3>
		<p>I think I have everything on my phone as I want it. I like the <a href="https://discuss.grapheneos.org/d/16670-private-space-on-android-15-grapheneos">Private Space</a> feature in GrapheneOS to be able to setup Google Play Services but not have it run on my main profile. The only reason I found I needed this was so that I could <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cast">cast</a> things to speakers in my home. I haven't been able to find an alternative for this for playing music in my house so until then, this works.</p>
	</article>
	<article id="day-10">
		<h2>2025-12-10</h2>
		<h3>Day 10</h3>
		<p>I've been saving a few links related to styles that I want to actually work on implementing on my site. I also want to try out some different fonts to see if anything fits my current layout. I will be doing this over the next few days so I might not actually post more or make these public until I'm happy with it.</p>
	</article>
	<article id="day-11">
		<h2>2025-12-11</h2>
		<h3>Day 11</h3>
		<p>There's so many good fonts but none of them really work here for me. It's not time wasted though because now I think I have better ideas of what layout changes I could make in the future to make these fonts work.</p>
	</article>
	<article id="day-12">
		<h2>2025-12-12</h2>
		<h3>Day 12</h3>
		<p>I've been putting off removing FontAwesome from <a href="https://sparkles.sploot.com">sparkles</a> so I finally started this process. For now I'm changing it to <a href="https://phosphoricons.com/">Phosphor Icons</a> since that's what I use for my site.</p>
	</article>
	<article id="day-15" class="today">
		<h2>2025-12-15</h2>
		<h3>Day 15</h3>
		<p>This is taking a little longer than expected. I find myself pretty happy with <a href="https://sparkles.sploot.com">sparkles</a> as a micropub client but I wish now I would've gone for a different setup altogether. I still really like <a href="https://mithril.js.org/">Mithril</a> for a framework, it's more the lack of actual PWA support on my phone and generally that makes me a bit upset.</p>
