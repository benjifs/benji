*This post is my **actual** entry for [IndieWeb Movie Club #006](https://marksuth.dev/posts/2025/02/indieweb-movie-club-feb-2025-romeo-juliet).*

[Mark](https://marksuth.dev/) is hosting this month's [IndieWeb Movie Club](https://indieweb.org/indieweb-movie-club)
and there are still a little time if you are interested in watching any of the
[many adaptations of Romeo and Juliet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_based_on_Romeo_and_Juliet).

I watched the following three films for this month's movie club:

## Romeo + Juliet (1996)

This has been on my "to rewatch" list for a long time but I kept putting it off as I didn't want
the memory of a movie I remember liking to be ruined. Luckily, this movie still holds up to me.

The second half of the film kinda drags on a bit I kinda wish it had a bit more of the "flair" that
the first half does, but this might just be my bias because I always loved [Harold Perrineau](https://www.themoviedb.org/person/6195-harold-perrineau)'s
performance as Mercutio and <spoiler>he dies in the first half</spoiler>.

Before this movie club, this was the only version of Romeo and Juliet I had ever seen so this has
always been my point of reference for this story.

## Die in a Gunfight (2021)

I don't even know where to begin with this one. I found this movie in some list after searching for
"List of movies based on Romeo and Juliet" and only watched it because I didn't see it on any other
list. Maybe this was a hidden gem and I was about to unearth the greatest adaptation of Romeo and
Juliet in modern cinema history.

This felt like it was trying to parody the Romeo and Juliet story and [Baz Luhrmann](https://www.themoviedb.org/person/6201-baz-luhrmann)'s
[adaptation](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/454-romeo-juliet). It was uncomfortable to watch and
I don't know if I would consider this even a loose adaptation of the original story as the only thing
it really shares is the two big families not wanting their kids together.

There is a neat animation to tell the prologue and some of the sets and outfits really are beautiful to see.

## Romeo & Juliet (2021)

This film was a complete surprise to me. I chose it because I wanted to see a stage adaptation and
the fact that this was filmed the way it was in the middle of a global pandemic is kind amazing.
The way this film transitions from stage to the bigger film sets gives it a sense of magic that adds
so much to this adaptation.

Not to discredit the other films I watched here, but this was the only version of the three where I
actually believed the characters fell in love as quick and as strong as they did.

I think if I'm pointing anyone to a Romeo and Juliet adaptation, this would probably be it for me.

## Final thoughts

How does this story get to tell us how it ends 2 seconds in and I'm still hoping it doesn't end that
way? What if Romeo waited an extra minute? What if he had heard of Juliet's plan? What if their parents
weren't enemies? What if...
