I like themes. I've worked with multiple themes over the years and I always come back to trying to build my own.

Here's [Sylveon](https://github.com/benjifs/sylveon).

I used the following tools to help build it and preview the colors as I was working on it:

- [themer.dev](https://themer.dev/)
- [terminal.sexy](https://terminal.sexy/)
- [colorpalettedemo.herokuapp.com](https://colorpalettedemo.herokuapp.com)
- [colorhexa.com](https://www.colorhexa.com/)
- [bytefluent.com/vivify](https://bytefluent.com/vivify/)

I also created a theme for Vim with [Vivify](http://bytefluent.com/vivify/) but in the end, I preferred sticking to [noctu.vim](https://github.com/noahfrederick/vim-noctu).
