I don't believe I was tagged by anyone but wanted to join in as it seemed like a
fun writing challenge. A different version of this lives in my [colophon](/colophon)
but this is possibly a more readable and easier to understand version.

### 1. Why did you make the blog in the first place?
I'm not sure if I consider my site a blog. I wrote the first versions of this
website in 2015 and it just used to be a landing page with links to other sites
and the rare blog post. Sometime later I learned more about the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org)
and I decided that instead of posting [random thoughts](/notes), [movie watches](/watched),
[book reads](/read), and [photos](/photos) elsewhere I would use my site as
the main place where I post things and here we are.

### 2. Why did you choose [the blogging software/platform/tool you use]?
Everything was originally handwritten HTML but this involved a lot of copying and
pasting code which was OK when there were only 5 pages. A [static site generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator)
made sense to me since I wanted to be able to build and upload to a server with
minimal setup on that side. After trying out a few, I stuck with this fairly new
project at the time called [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) and haven't looked back.

I've also been on and off selfhosting and using [Netlify](https://netlify.com) to
publish my site. Lastly, I wrote a [serverless micropub endpoint](https://github.com/benjifs/micropub)
which would be able to add posts to my site by using a [Micropub Client](https://indieweb.org/Micropub/Clients)
and, even though it hasn't been really updated in a few years, I'm happy to say
it's still working well for my setup.

### 3. Have you blogged on other platforms before?
I've posted online in several places including forums, Blogger, MySpace, Tumblr,
Medium, dev.to and they all worked for me well at the time. I have also tried out
other blogging platforms for work but never have really used them for myself.

### 4. Do you write your posts directly in the editor or in another software?
Most of the stuff that I post on my site I write directly in my micropub client: [spakles](https://sparkles.sploot.com).
There are a few situations where if it's an [article](/article) with a little more
complex formatting and styling, I load up my local dev environment and write the
post in my text editor.

### 5. When do you feel most inspired to write?
Inspiration usually comes right after reading something from other [blogs I follow](/linkroll).

### 6. Do you publish immediately after writing or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?
I find myself writing and never posting more often than actually posting. I think
writing is good practice for me and it helps me build confidence for when I actually
hit publish. I currently have eight posts in drafts and some may stay there forever
while others my eventually get posted.

### 7. Your favorite post on your blog?
I really liked writing my [Films To Be Buried With](/articles/films-to-be-buried-with/) post
as that is a podcast I really enjoy and I already spent my time while listening to it
thinking about my answers. In terms of style or fun features, I liked writing [My Favorite Mugs](/articles/my-favorite-mugs/)
as I got to play around with SVGs and interactive images.

### 8. Any future plans for your blog?
I sometimes wish I had time to redesign things but the truth is I'm quite happy
with how things look and I also don't have a better idea. In terms of things you
may not see but I've been planning to work on for a while is rewritting my [Micropub Endpoint](https://github.com/benjifs/micropub)
as I want that to be a little easier to use for others than the current way it's
setup. I do sometimes add things to my [/TODO](/TODO) which aren't necessarily tasks
as much as they are ideas for someday.
