      "html": "<p>In the recent IndieWeb event (I think it was the <a href=\"https://events.indieweb.org/2023/11/indieweb-black-friday-create-day-build-don-t-buy-P4ZVmtnyGR6v\">Black Friday Create Day</a>, but I am not 100% sure if it was), there was a discussion about the microformats. We then continued this conversation somehow in the next <a href=\"https://events.indieweb.org/2023/11/homebrew-website-club-europe-london-gqkpIDcSouHX\">London Homebrew club</a>.</p>\n<p>The conversation started with, may have been <a href=\"https://www.benji.dog\">Benji</a>'s idea of having sort of like a planet or aggregator for movies. Basically, to see what the people around are watching and how much they are liking the thing, they are watching. </p>\n<p>The conversation went into two direction. One was how to use the algorithm (they wanted to use artificial intelligence), that would be able to discover the watch posts. Though, in the later session, we did also touch upon the problems of post types - what type of post is, when somebody goes to the cinema to watch a movie and writes a review of the venue. A watch post? A checkin? A review?</p>\n<p>But I would like to address the second point. The reason the conversation went in the direction of automatic detection of the post type was, that most people are not marking up their watch movies. And that this is always a chicken and egg problem - nobody markup their sites, so it is not possible to build anything for the lack of data and this again does not give the the users reasons to markup their data.</p>\n<p>And I am not saying that this is not a problem. I think <a href=\"https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/searching-for-a-recipe\">Jeremy mentioned it related to recipes once</a>. </p>\n<p>So in order to try and see how much of the problem is, I went to the <a href=\"https://microformats.org/wiki/\">Microformats wiki</a> and the <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/wiki/\">IndieWeb wiki</a> and tried to see, if I could mark them in this way. I started to search for movie and film and went from then.</p>\n<p>Now, I don't make watch posts. But I do keep track of <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/movies-and-series/\">all the movies and series that I have watched</a>. </p>\n<p>And I do mention movies in the blog posts related to non-movie related topics. Here is <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/2023/11/the-messiness-of-creativity-with-some-paraphrasing-from-the-q-and-a-with-lola-director/\">one on creativity inspired by director interview</a>, a <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/2023/12/prostitutes-for-political-prisoners-moriarty-the-patriot/\">fanfiction story, where I got the idea while watching the movie</a> and another one about <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/2023/12/which-skills-are-important-my-rant-about-the-tech-job-interviewing\">how all types of knowledge are useful</a>. </p>\n<p>None of which could be classified into a different watch posts. I don't really have different post types precisely because I think they would box my writing to much. I already box myself in my writing too much by the simple reason of how having enough time to write every idea that I have an my interests.</p>\n<p>But checking the wikies, the only thing that I could find about it is the property <code>u-watch-of</code>? And it seems much more related to the watching of the internet videos than anything? </p>\n<p>I watched about 5-times more movies in the cinema then any other media combined (including internet, streaming and DVDs). So even if I link to them, it is not really to the movie itself, but to the information about the movie? Still, it was not hard to find the couple of recent examples in the posts and add another class to it.</p>\n<p>It also does not really indicate, that this is a movie, right? I guess this could also be use to indicate watching a Youtube videos like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_TnANwRRyI\" class=\"u-watch-of\">this one</a> or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaPgDQkmqqM\" class=\"u-watch-of\">this one</a>?</p>\n<p>So is this the end? Is there something else, that I should be marking? Because it does not seems like it would be that useful. On the other hand, I did not really find any information about what to do more of?</p>\n<p>So I think it is a bit premature to say that nobody would be willing to markup, if there is not even easy way to figure out how to markup.</p>\n<p>And yes, I work for the software company. I understand that to the many people that program, it is a lot more fun to figure out programmatic way to figure things out instead of writing an accessible documentation. :) </p>\n<p>On the other side... I might be biased, since my job at work is writing and maintaining integration. I am sure that even with people not marking anything, it would be possible to build a proof of concepts. Scraping is not that scary, and in these cases, you probably don't even need to deal with the methods, that would actively try to block you. </p>\n<p>I am sure enough people post this data (wiki have <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/watch\">some examples</a>, and there are probably other on the internet) for at least showing some possible prototype. And maybe some accessible information about how to add ourselves. </p>\n<p>I think this community have enough joiners to have at least something.</p>\n<p>Sure, this is all under the assumption, that this is something we do want. If nobody is willing to work on any of the sides of this problem, then maybe this is not a problem that we need solving. There is no point in maintaining code, that nobody is that interested in using. </p>",

The reason the conversation went in the direction of automatic detection of the post type was, that most people are not marking up their watch movies. And that this is always a chicken and egg problem - nobody markup their sites, so it is not possible to build anything for the lack of data and this again does not give the the users reasons to markup their data.\nAnd I am not saying that this is not a problem. I think Jeremy mentioned it related to recipes once. \nSo in order to try and see how much of the problem is, I went to the Microformats wiki and the IndieWeb wiki and tried to see, if I could mark them in this way. I started to search for movie and film and went from then.\nNow, I don't make watch posts. But I do keep track of all the movies and series that I have watched. \nAnd I do mention movies in the blog posts related to non-movie related topics. Here is one on creativity inspired by director interview, a fanfiction story, where I got the idea while watching the movie and another one about how all types of knowledge are useful. \nNone of which could be classified into a different watch posts. I don't really have different post types precisely because I think they would box my writing to much. I already box myself in my writing too much by the simple reason of how having enough time to write every idea that I have an my interests.\nBut checking the wikies, the only thing that I could find about it is the property u-watch-of? And it seems much more related to the watching of the internet videos than anything? \nI watched about 5-times more movies in the cinema then any other media combined (including internet, streaming and DVDs). So even if I link to them, it is not really to the movie itself, but to the information about the movie? Still, it was not hard to find the couple of recent examples in the posts and add another class to it.\nIt also does not really indicate, that this is a movie, right? I guess this could also be use to indicate watching a Youtube videos like this one or this one?\nSo is this the end? Is there something else, that I should be marking? Because it does not seems like it would be that useful. On the other hand, I did not really find any information about what to do more of?\nSo I think it is a bit premature to say that nobody would be willing to markup, if there is not even easy way to figure out how to markup.\nAnd yes, I work for the software company. I understand that to the many people that program, it is a lot more fun to figure out programmatic way to figure things out instead of writing an accessible documentation. :) \nOn the other side... I might be biased, since my job at work is writing and maintaining integration. I am sure that even with people not marking anything, it would be possible to build a proof of concepts. Scraping is not that scary, and in these cases, you probably don't even need to deal with the methods, that would actively try to block you. \nI am sure enough people post this data (wiki have some examples, and there are probably other on the internet) for at least showing some possible prototype. And maybe some accessible information about how to add ourselves. \nI think this community have enough joiners to have at least something.\nSure, this is all under the assumption, that this is something we do want. If nobody is willing to work on any of the sides of this problem, then maybe this is not a problem that we need solving. There is no point in maintaining code, that nobody is that interested in using."

      "html": "<h3>Motivation for the Project</h3>\n<p>Recently <a href=\"https://www.benji.dog/\">Benji</a> had brought up the idea of the movie aggregator. We had conversation about it on a couple of Homebrew website clubs, there was a session <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/2023/SD/movieviewings\">about it on San Diego IndieWeb Camp</a> and we had a conversation about it through our site (starting with <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/2023/12/the-chicken-egg-problem-of-movie-microformats/\">this</a> and currently, probably finished, <a href=\"https://www.benji.dog/notes/1702277465/\">here</a>). </p>\n<p>If I understood his idea, his idea was more a feed of movies that people were watching. And the review aggregator. Now, I do post the <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/movies-and-series/\">list of movies I watched</a>, but I don't do separate posts and I don't do reviews or rating. After this project, I could be convinced otherwise on the reviews, but still don't want to put the numerical rating on it. </p>\n<p>But I found the idea of finding the common interest interesting. Could this be used to see, if some people are watching common movies? What I would be even more interested is to see, if there are some common books we are reading. </p>\n<p>But unlike with books, where I do read books outside of Goodreads, Open Library or Google Books, and even with the ISBN numbers, there does not seems to be a good way to connect different editions and different translations and so on. Open Library is having this data for the books in their database. It seems that this problem would require some more work.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I have yet to watch the movie, that was not in the <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/\">IMDB (Internet Movie Database)</a>. So as long as I could sort of map it to there, I would have a way to connect movies for different members.</p>\n<h3>The First Proof of Concept</h3>\n<p>So I have created the <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/projects/indieweb-movies/\">first proof of concept</a> to see, if anybody is even interested in this. </p>\n<p>It had the three parts to it. </p>\n<p>The first part is the <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/projects/indieweb-movies/network.html\">network representation of the common movies</a>. It does require JavaScript, so for the people that have it blocked, here is the current picture.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"common movies between 5 indieweb members\" src=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/content/images/2023/movies-network.png\" /></p>\n<p>It simply shows either just the common movies or all the movies, and it is possible to filter by IMDB genre. Something that looks pretty. It was also the idea I started with, which is why it stayed the part of it.</p>\n<p>The second one is some <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/projects/indieweb-movies/stats.html\">general statistics</a>. It starts with the leader board of the common movies. I was a bit surprised, that it was Enola Holmes who was the most watched movie. Not the best movie I watched this year, but also not the worst movie I watched this year.</p>\n<p>After that, there are some general statistics of the movie based on the IMDB metadata. I found two things interesting: the year distribution of the movies (the oldest movie watched was from 1900) and the country distribution (we hit all the continents sans Antarctica). </p>\n<p>Though it also made me realise all the problems I have with the IMDB metadata.</p>\n<p>The third one is the <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/projects/indieweb-movies/posters.html\">posters page</a>. It just lists the posters of the watched movies, with the list of people that watched it underneath. </p>\n<p>It also allows filtering by the IMDB metadata. Currently one can only filter by one thing at the time. Just some playing.</p>\n<p>If you want to see the representation of my problem with the IMDB metadata, then just try to filter the movies by country Japan. It includes a lot of movies, that I would not put there, as I would not consider them Japanese movies. But it is easily accessible, so it is there.</p>\n<h3>Technical Background</h3>\n<p>It is a statically generated site. In the background it is this <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/projects/indieweb-movies/Movies%20Analysis.ipynb\">jupyter notebook</a>. I have used <a href=\"https://omdbapi.com/\">OMDb API</a> in the background to get movies metadata and to try to recognise the movies in the posts, that do not have the IMDB URLs in their watched movies list. </p>\n<p>To update the data, I need to run this code locally. So in updates on the sporadic timetable. </p>\n<h3>Thanks to the Early Participants</h3>\n<p>I would here like to thank <a href=\"https://www.benji.dog/\">Benji</a>, <a href=\"https://www.jeremycherfas.net/\">Jeremy</a>, <a href=\"https://marksuth.dev/\">Mark</a> and <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com\">Tracy</a> to give me permission to scrape their data and use it in this project. </p>\n<h3>Volunteer for Participation</h3>\n<p>If you want to have your data included in this project, please <a href=\"mailto:sarajaksa@sarajaksa.eu\">contact me</a>. I prefer to not use the data from somebody else without their permission. Lets us try to be more ethical then the current tech industry. :)</p>\n<p>Also, at least two people pointed me to the better source of movies on their site. Without it, I would have listed a smaller amount of movies for them.</p>\n<h3>Future Ideas</h3>\n<p>Surprisingly, it was the poster page, that had so far provided the most utility to me. It reminded me of the movies that I wanted to watch, but did not yet. And I could check, if they have the DVDs for them in the library. </p>\n<p>In the last year <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/2022/Pop-ups/Personal_Libraries\">pop up about libraries on the websites</a>, there was the idea of the book club. If we could find the common books that multiple people wanted to read, we could have an IndieWeb-like book club. Or something in this direction? And if I could parse the want-to-read book in the same way, it would be possible to see is there are any common books. Or if done with the already read books, to be able to have book discussions?</p>\n<p>And I guess the same could be done with movies? I am in one of the group, that does online groups movie watching, so if somebody would be interested in that, this could also be possible?

Something about having the code for the map refer to the image, all in the same markup, and without relying on CSS, makes me think that as long as you have that pair the code will work when the thing you made gets moved, copied, and repurposed.\nFun stuff!"
