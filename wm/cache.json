Lot's of good things have happened. I've overcame a few things. I started my blog again. The little things add up. One of the major events was becoming part of the IndieWeb Community. It's been a great community that is welcoming. I have learned so much from the people in the community and at Homebrew Website Club. Every single one of them has been pretty amazing.</p>\n\n<p>Since it's Send a Friend a Webmention Day, I want to send a webmention to a few people.</p>\n\n<p><a class=\"u-in-reply-to\" href=\"https://ragt.ag\">Angelo Gladding</a></p>\n\n<p>You were the first person I interacted with at Homebrew Website Club. He gave me the run down and help me connect the pieces based on the information I knew already. Thanks for being so rad! Your bot trained with your voice is pretty tight alongside your mediasoup-based setup.</p>\n\n<p><a class=\"u-in-reply-to\" href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/\">Tracy Durnell</a>\nI really enjoy your style of writing! I have been looking for better ways to express myself through writing and to find my style of blogging, it's inspiring and I enjoy your content. I've been wanting to make the <a class=\"u-in-reply-to\" href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/recipes/apple-crumb-pie/\">Apple crumb pie</a>. I'm excited to try it soon! If you need some more information on Oaxacan cuisine, I'm your guy!</p>\n\n<p><a class=\"u-in-reply-to\" href=\"https://jamesg.blog/\">James G</a>\nEverything you do is super cool especially the programming language you created! You'll have to try some Coffee (and <em>hot chocolate</em>) from Oaxaca. I really enjoyed this month's IndieWeb Carnival topic.</p>\n\n<p><a class=\"u-in-reply-to\" href=\"https://benji.dog/\">Benji</a>\nI love what you are doing with your site. I love the minimalist approach. The Sparkles is so rad! It works beautifully with one of my sites.</p>\n\n<p><a class=\"u-in-reply-to\" href=\"https://gregorlove.com/\">gRegor Love</a>\nI hope you picked the blue shirt! I still haven't seen the movie? Yay or nay? Thank you for pointing me in the right directions when it comes to marking up content in a different language.

Lot's of good things have happened. I've overcame a few things. I started my blog again. The little things add up. One of the major events was becoming part of the IndieWeb Community. It's been a great community that is welcoming. I have learned so much from the people in the community and at Homebrew Website Club. Every single one of them has been pretty amazing.\n\nSince it's Send a Friend a Webmention Day, I want to send a webmention to a few people.\n\nAngelo Gladding\n\nYou were the first person I interacted with at Homebrew Website Club. He gave me the run down and help me connect the pieces based on the information I knew already. Thanks for being so rad! Your bot trained with your voice is pretty tight alongside your mediasoup-based setup.\n\nTracy Durnell\nI really enjoy your style of writing! I have been looking for better ways to express myself through writing and to find my style of blogging, it's inspiring and I enjoy your content. I've been wanting to make the Apple crumb pie. I'm excited to try it soon! If you need some more information on Oaxacan cuisine, I'm your guy!\n\nJames G\nEverything you do is super cool especially the programming language you created! You'll have to try some Coffee (and hot chocolate) from Oaxaca. I really enjoyed this month's IndieWeb Carnival topic.\n\nBenji\nI love what you are doing with your site. I love the minimalist approach. The Sparkles is so rad! It works beautifully with one of my sites.\n\ngRegor Love\nI hope you picked the blue shirt! I still haven't seen the movie? Yay or nay? Thank you for pointing me in the right directions when it comes to marking up content in a different language. More of content in different languages coming soon.\n\nAlex Sirac\nTon site, Réussir Mes Études est super cool et informatif! J'aime le blog de ton site web principal. You've inspired me to write in French again!\n\nJo dead.garden\nSince I love languages, I started looking into toki pona. Thank you so much for sharing this.\n\nAnthony Ciccarello\nThank you for helping me out microformats and \"likes\" and getting that squared away.

        "html": "<p>In the recent IndieWeb event (I think it was the <a href=\"https://events.indieweb.org/2023/11/indieweb-black-friday-create-day-build-don-t-buy-P4ZVmtnyGR6v\">Black Friday Create Day</a>, but I am not 100% sure if it was), there was a discussion about the microformats. We then continued this conversation somehow in the next <a href=\"https://events.indieweb.org/2023/11/homebrew-website-club-europe-london-gqkpIDcSouHX\">London Homebrew club</a>.</p>\n<p>The conversation started with, may have been <a href=\"https://www.benji.dog\">Benji</a>'s idea of having sort of like a planet or aggregator for movies. Basically, to see what the people around are watching and how much they are liking the thing, they are watching. </p>\n<p>The conversation went into two direction. One was how to use the algorithm (they wanted to use artificial intelligence), that would be able to discover the watch posts. Though, in the later session, we did also touch upon the problems of post types - what type of post is, when somebody goes to the cinema to watch a movie and writes a review of the venue. A watch post? A checkin? A review?</p>\n<p>But I would like to address the second point. The reason the conversation went in the direction of automatic detection of the post type was, that most people are not marking up their watch movies. And that this is always a chicken and egg problem - nobody markup their sites, so it is not possible to build anything for the lack of data and this again does not give the the users reasons to markup their data.</p>\n<p>And I am not saying that this is not a problem. I think <a href=\"https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/searching-for-a-recipe\">Jeremy mentioned it related to recipes once</a>. </p>\n<p>So in order to try and see how much of the problem is, I went to the <a href=\"https://microformats.org/wiki/\">Microformats wiki</a> and the <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/wiki/\">IndieWeb wiki</a> and tried to see, if I could mark them in this way. I started to search for movie and film and went from then.</p>\n<p>Now, I don't make watch posts. But I do keep track of <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/movies-and-series/\">all the movies and series that I have watched</a>. </p>\n<p>And I do mention movies in the blog posts related to non-movie related topics. Here is <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/2023/11/the-messiness-of-creativity-with-some-paraphrasing-from-the-q-and-a-with-lola-director/\">one on creativity inspired by director interview</a>, a <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/2023/12/prostitutes-for-political-prisoners-moriarty-the-patriot/\">fanfiction story, where I got the idea while watching the movie</a> and another one about <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/2023/12/which-skills-are-important-my-rant-about-the-tech-job-interviewing\">how all types of knowledge are useful</a>. </p>\n<p>None of which could be classified into a different watch posts. I don't really have different post types precisely because I think they would box my writing to much. I already box myself in my writing too much by the simple reason of how having enough time to write every idea that I have an my interests.</p>\n<p>But checking the wikies, the only thing that I could find about it is the property <code>u-watch-of</code>? And it seems much more related to the watching of the internet videos than anything? </p>\n<p>I watched about 5-times more movies in the cinema then any other media combined (including internet, streaming and DVDs). So even if I link to them, it is not really to the movie itself, but to the information about the movie? Still, it was not hard to find the couple of recent examples in the posts and add another class to it.</p>\n<p>It also does not really indicate, that this is a movie, right? I guess this could also be use to indicate watching a Youtube videos like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_TnANwRRyI\" class=\"u-watch-of\">this one</a> or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaPgDQkmqqM\" class=\"u-watch-of\">this one</a>?</p>\n<p>So is this the end? Is there something else, that I should be marking? Because it does not seems like it would be that useful. On the other hand, I did not really find any information about what to do more of?</p>\n<p>So I think it is a bit premature to say that nobody would be willing to markup, if there is not even easy way to figure out how to markup.</p>\n<p>And yes, I work for the software company.

        "text": "In the recent IndieWeb event (I think it was the Black Friday Create Day, but I am not 100% sure if it was), there was a discussion about the microformats. We then continued this conversation somehow in the next London Homebrew club.\nThe conversation started with, may have been Benji's idea of having sort of like a planet or aggregator for movies. Basically, to see what the people around are watching and how much they are liking the thing, they are watching. \nThe conversation went into two direction. One was how to use the algorithm (they wanted to use artificial intelligence), that would be able to discover the watch posts. Though, in the later session, we did also touch upon the problems of post types - what type of post is, when somebody goes to the cinema to watch a movie and writes a review of the venue. A watch post? A checkin? A review?\nBut I would like to address the second point. The reason the conversation went in the direction of automatic detection of the post type was, that most people are not marking up their watch movies. And that this is always a chicken and egg problem - nobody markup their sites, so it is not possible to build anything for the lack of data and this again does not give the the users reasons to markup their data.\nAnd I am not saying that this is not a problem. I think Jeremy mentioned it related to recipes once. \nSo in order to try and see how much of the problem is, I went to the Microformats wiki and the IndieWeb wiki and tried to see, if I could mark them in this way. I started to search for movie and film and went from then.\nNow, I don't make watch posts. But I do keep track of all the movies and series that I have watched. \nAnd I do mention movies in the blog posts related to non-movie related topics. Here is one on creativity inspired by director interview, a fanfiction story, where I got the idea while watching the movie and another one about how all types of knowledge are useful. \nNone of which could be classified into a different watch posts. I don't really have different post types precisely because I think they would box my writing to much. I already box myself in my writing too much by the simple reason of how having enough time to write every idea that I have an my interests.\nBut checking the wikies, the only thing that I could find about it is the property u-watch-of? And it seems much more related to the watching of the internet videos than anything? \nI watched about 5-times more movies in the cinema then any other media combined (including internet, streaming and DVDs). So even if I link to them, it is not really to the movie itself, but to the information about the movie? Still, it was not hard to find the couple of recent examples in the posts and add another class to it.\nIt also does not really indicate, that this is a movie, right? I guess this could also be use to indicate watching a Youtube videos like this one or this one?\nSo is this the end? Is there something else, that I should be marking? Because it does not seems like it would be that useful. On the other hand, I did not really find any information about what to do more of?\nSo I think it is a bit premature to say that nobody would be willing to markup, if there is not even easy way to figure out how to markup.\nAnd yes, I work for the software company. I understand that to the many people that program, it is a lot more fun to figure out programmatic way to figure things out instead of writing an accessible documentation. :) \nOn the other side... I might be biased, since my job at work is writing and maintaining integration. I am sure that even with people not marking anything, it would be possible to build a proof of concepts. Scraping is not that scary, and in these cases, you probably don't even need to deal with the methods, that would actively try to block you. \nI am sure enough people post this data (wiki have some examples, and there are probably other on the internet) for at least showing some possible prototype. And maybe some accessible information about how to add ourselves. \nI think this community have enough joiners to have at least something.\nSure, this is all under the assumption, that this is something we do want. If nobody is willing to work on any of the sides of this problem, then maybe this is not a problem that we need solving.

        "html": "<h3>Motivation for the Project</h3>\n<p>Recently <a href=\"https://www.benji.dog/\">Benji</a> had brought up the idea of the movie aggregator. We had conversation about it on a couple of Homebrew website clubs, there was a session <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/2023/SD/movieviewings\">about it on San Diego IndieWeb Camp</a> and we had a conversation about it through our site (starting with <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/2023/12/the-chicken-egg-problem-of-movie-microformats/\">this</a> and currently, probably finished, <a href=\"https://www.benji.dog/notes/1702277465/\">here</a>). </p>\n<p>If I understood his idea, his idea was more a feed of movies that people were watching. And the review aggregator. Now, I do post the <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/movies-and-series/\">list of movies I watched</a>, but I don't do separate posts and I don't do reviews or rating. After this project, I could be convinced otherwise on the reviews, but still don't want to put the numerical rating on it. </p>\n<p>But I found the idea of finding the common interest interesting. Could this be used to see, if some people are watching common movies? What I would be even more interested is to see, if there are some common books we are reading. </p>\n<p>But unlike with books, where I do read books outside of Goodreads, Open Library or Google Books, and even with the ISBN numbers, there does not seems to be a good way to connect different editions and different translations and so on. Open Library is having this data for the books in their database. It seems that this problem would require some more work.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I have yet to watch the movie, that was not in the <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/\">IMDB (Internet Movie Database)</a>. So as long as I could sort of map it to there, I would have a way to connect movies for different members.</p>\n<h3>The First Proof of Concept</h3>\n<p>So I have created the <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/projects/indieweb-movies/\">first proof of concept</a> to see, if anybody is even interested in this. </p>\n<p>It had the three parts to it. </p>\n<p>The first part is the <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/projects/indieweb-movies/network.html\">network representation of the common movies</a>. It does require JavaScript, so for the people that have it blocked, here is the current picture.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"common movies between 5 indieweb members\" src=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/content/images/2023/movies-network.png\" /></p>\n<p>It simply shows either just the common movies or all the movies, and it is possible to filter by IMDB genre. Something that looks pretty. It was also the idea I started with, which is why it stayed the part of it.</p>\n<p>The second one is some <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/projects/indieweb-movies/stats.html\">general statistics</a>. It starts with the leader board of the common movies. I was a bit surprised, that it was Enola Holmes who was the most watched movie. Not the best movie I watched this year, but also not the worst movie I watched this year.</p>\n<p>After that, there are some general statistics of the movie based on the IMDB metadata. I found two things interesting: the year distribution of the movies (the oldest movie watched was from 1900) and the country distribution (we hit all the continents sans Antarctica). </p>\n<p>Though it also made me realise all the problems I have with the IMDB metadata.</p>\n<p>The third one is the <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/projects/indieweb-movies/posters.html\">posters page</a>. It just lists the posters of the watched movies, with the list of people that watched it underneath. </p>\n<p>It also allows filtering by the IMDB metadata. Currently one can only filter by one thing at the time. Just some playing.</p>\n<p>If you want to see the representation of my problem with the IMDB metadata, then just try to filter the movies by country Japan. It includes a lot of movies, that I would not put there, as I would not consider them Japanese movies. But it is easily accessible, so it is there.</p>\n<h3>Technical Background</h3>\n<p>It is a statically generated site. In the background it is this <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/projects/indieweb-movies/Movies%20Analysis.ipynb\">jupyter notebook</a>. I have used <a href=\"https://omdbapi.com/\">OMDb API</a> in the background to get movies metadata and to try to recognise the movies in the posts, that do not have the IMDB URLs in their watched movies list. </p>\n<p>To update the data, I need to run this code locally. So in updates on the sporadic timetable. </p>\n<h3>Thanks to the Early Participants</h3>\n<p>I would here like to thank <a href=\"https://www.benji.dog/\">Benji</a>, <a href=\"https://www.jeremycherfas.net/\">Jeremy</a>, <a href=\"https://marksuth.dev/\">Mark</a> and <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com\">Tracy</a> to give me permission to scrape their data and use it in this project. </p>\n<h3>Volunteer for Participation</h3>\n<p>If you want to have your data included in this project, please <a href=\"mailto:sarajaksa@sarajaksa.eu\">contact me</a>. I prefer to not use the data from somebody else without their permission. Lets us try to be more ethical then the current tech industry. :)</p>\n<p>Also, at least two people pointed me to the better source of movies on their site. Without it, I would have listed a smaller amount of movies for them.</p>\n<h3>Future Ideas</h3>\n<p>Surprisingly, it was the poster page, that had so far provided the most utility to me. It reminded me of the movies that I wanted to watch, but did not yet. And I could check, if they have the DVDs for them in the library. </p>\n<p>In the last year <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/2022/Pop-ups/Personal_Libraries\">pop up about libraries on the websites</a>, there was the idea of the book club. If we could find the common books that multiple people wanted to read, we could have an IndieWeb-like book club. Or something in this direction? And if I could parse the want-to-read book in the same way, it would be possible to see is there are any common books. Or if done with the already read books, to be able to have book discussions?</p>\n<p>And I guess the same could be done with movies? I am in one of the group, that does online groups movie watching, so if somebody would be interested in that, this could also be possible? In this case, I would also need to be parsing people's want-to-watch movies list. Do somebody even post this on their websites?</p>\n<h3>Any Feedback?</h3>\n<p>But honestly, I would be happy for some feedback. Is this something, that is interesting?

Today, the pace that new content is flung at us means that, without substantial willpower or intentionality, we’re so busy consuming <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2023/08/15/reserving-mental-space-for-myself/\">we don’t have time to <i>think</i></a>. <strong>Trying to keep up means we rarely take the time to step back and think about what we’re keeping up with.</strong> Dependent on pageviews for advertising revenue, publications pull every trick in the book to steal our attention. <strong>My own curiosities are swamped</strong> by the neverending pile of information dumped on my mental threshold each day.</p>\n<p><em>NB: in this post, I’m mostly talking about non-fiction books and articles online, though I also find my phone gets in the way of reading fiction sometimes too!</em></p>\n<p>Over the past couple years, I’ve <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2023/09/07/articles-i-read-today-september-7-2023/\">tracked everything I read in a day</a> <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2024/05/17/articles-i-read-today-may-16-2024/\">several times</a>. This gave me a better understanding of what I was reading, and <strong>how much I could actually read in a day — it’s less than I expected</strong>. Depending on length, it might be as few as five articles, or if I spend an entire Saturday lounging around reading the internet, as many as twenty articles. Let’s call it an average of fifteen. This knowledge alone has been enough to jolt me out of reading some stuff that was obviously attention bait – <i>is this worth one of my fifteen reading slots for the day?</i> (Reading for entertainment isn’t bad, I just want to do so intentionally.)</p>\n<p><strong>Information acts as a modern enchantment, keeping us in its sway.</strong> When I decide to read, I instinctively pick up my phone instead of a book. And as much as I think <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2024/11/30/the-impact-of-online-writing/\">online writing is valuable and important</a>, some writing is higher quality than others. (I don’t mean quality at the prose level, more <em>impact</em>. Because I also get annoyed by fancified writing that overcomplicates itself — I’ve learned to steer clear of literary reviews ????) I seem to gravitate towards the same kind of Substack personal essay, so if I unthinkingly read whatever has emotional pull, when I emerge from the haze, I realize I’ve read several interchangeable vibes pieces that I couldn’t tell you who wrote.</p>\n<p>I want to escape emotional manipulation and choose what I invest my limited time in more intentionally. If I notice I’m interested in a particular topic, I want to seek out and read higher quality material about it – more books! more complicated books! – when I have the mental energy. In essence, I want to <b>replace my “mental junk food” binge habit with more thoughtful reading</b>.</p>\n<p>As I’ve practiced being more intentional about what I read, I’ve honed in on a few filters for myself:</p>\n<h2>Three “rules” for attention</h2>\n<ol><li>Choose what to read based on <b><i>my </i></b><b>interest, not “to be an informed person”</b></li>\n<li><b>Be skeptical of titles that invoke fear</b>; be wary of articles framed to make me feel superior to others</li>\n<li>Prioritize information that will <b>directly impact my life or community</b>; pay less attention to news outside my control</li>\n</ol><p>I still fall for things that break these rules all the time, but having them has helped me turn down a lot of reading in favor of better options for me.</p>\n<h2>Why we feel the need to consume <i>more</i></h2>\n<p>My friend pointed out that <strong>our appetites developed in an age of scarcity</strong>, when we needed to consume as much as we could find, and more information was always better. We weren’t made to resist information, and our brains reward us for feeding ourselves more, even if those intellectual calories turn out to be hollow. In a world of scarcity, easy calories were a better choice than hard-to-get ones — but the information that’s easiest to come by is often the lowest quality, or worse, manipulative.</p>\n<p>Understanding <strong>the emotional forces that influence what I decide to read</strong> is my first step towards asserting control over what information I spend my time and mental energy on.</p>\n<h3>Information makes us feel in control</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://haleynahman.substack.com/p/172-the-pleasure-of-not-knowing\">Haley Nahman recognizes how our consumption habits assuage our anxiety</a>: “There are infinite resources available to quell our voids.” <strong>Having the theoretical ability to have information makes us feel like we <i>need </i>it.</strong> Yet our anxiety “isn’t caused by a lack of answers to [our] swirl of questions, but the swirl itself.” I have anxiety, and our modern information system seems tailor-made to feed off and amplify my worries.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the reason we keep <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2024/09/11/article-pairing-missing-information/\">gathering information</a> is that <b>we conflate being informed with being in control</b>. With <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2023/05/04/discerning-the-value-of-note-taking/\">enough knowledge</a>, we’ll never lose our jobs, we’ll keep ourselves and our loved ones safe, we’ll know how to survive if the government really starts rounding up leftists.<a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2022/05/13/article-pairing-stop-reading-the-news/\"> Knowing what’s going on in D.C. at every moment</a> becomes a way to feel that we are participating, believe that we understand what’s happening, and assure ourselves that we will be able to react to whatever happens.</p>\n<p><b>Gathering information substitutes knowledge for action.</b> In <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2024/12/28/read-capitalist-realism/\">Capitalist Realism</a>, Mark Fisher describes the concept of interpassivity:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“A film like Wall-E exemplifies what Robert Pfaller has called <b>‘interpassivity’: the film performs our anticapitalism for us, allowing us to continue to consume with impunity. </b>The role of capitalist ideology is not to make an explicit case for something in the way that propaganda does, but to conceal the fact that the operations of capital do not depend on any sort of subjectively assumed belief.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>In essence, consuming content that expresses our desire for change stands in place of acting for change. (I am definitely guilty of this!)</p>\n<p><b>I find my emotions manipulated into reading things that, frankly, do not matter to my life.</b> They are outside my realm of influence, but I have been carried along into caring about them by headlines that enrage. <b>My emotional energy is expended on things that I cannot control</b>, leaving me less for the things that I could have some influence on.</p>\n<h3>We fear not being enough</h3>\n<p>Tricia Hersey argues in <i>Rest is Resistance</i> that “Grind culture has placed fear as our only compass and keeps us frozen in a way that is now a habit.”</p>\n<p>As<a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2024/05/04/scale-requires-deskilling/\"> workers’ skills are devalued</a>, we feel pressure to constantly be learning new ones to make sure we’re still needed by the market. With the rise of the<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10696419-the-precariat\"> precariat class</a> — and more and more workers becoming part of it — performing knowledge acquisition can become more important than actually learning things (have you visited LinkedIn lately). We lean on book summaries, we listen to audio books on 2x, 3x speed so we can fit in more. <b>Unconsciously, </b><b><i>value </i></b><b>becomes the key heuristic for any piece of media we engage with. </b>But it’s toxic to expect that every thing we read deliver market-ready insights, an expectation that erodes the perceived worth of any information that isn’t immediately applicable. We don’t feel we have time to wait for insights to arise naturally, but instead feed ourselves as much information as we can. Bread <em>and</em> roses, went the Labor slogan — this mindset says never mind the flowers.</p>\n<p>Johann Hari <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2023/07/31/read-stolen-focus/\">describes how this feels as a writer</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I fattened myself with information every waking hour to make myself a more productive writer, and I had started to think that the way I lived was a bit like the process where, in a factory farm, a foie gras goose is force-fed gross amounts in order to turn its liver into pâté.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Chris Bailey <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2023/03/24/read-how-to-calm-your-mind/\">identifies this as the accomplishment mindset</a>, which “leads us to always want to fill our time with something — and feel guilty when we’re spending our time in a ‘nonoptimal’ way.” At the root of the mindset? “[O]ur relentless pursuit of <i>more</i>.” In <i>Four Thousand Weeks</i>, Oliver Burkeman writes, “The fundamental problem is that this attitude toward time sets up a rigged game in which it’s <b>impossible ever to feel as though you’re doing well enough</b>.”</p>\n<p>Tara McMullin <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2023/03/08/read-what-works/\">hones in on <b>self-worth</b></a> as the underlying value behind this urge: “We seek validation for our worthiness and usefulness in our families, in our jobs, in our friendships, and even in the quiet moments we call ‘me time.'” More and more, <b>our status – and emotional safety – relies on our online performance to even our offline communities</b>, whether that is via Facebook or LinkedIn.</p>\n<h3>Cultural consumption is participation</h3>\n<p>Much of what we read is for social reasons. I realized recently that <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2024/11/30/the-impact-of-online-writing/\">most individual online writing – not just on social media, but on blogs too – is part of oral culture</a>; we are online to be social, even if that sociality is asynchronous. <b>With fewer non-commercial places to gather, we have less opportunity to simply </b><b><i>be </i></b><b>or </b><b><i>do </i></b><b>with each other, so we go online and </b><b><i>consume </i></b><b>together. </b></p>\n<p>Sarah LaBrie <a href=\"https://1234kyle5678.substack.com/p/memoirs-are-so-hot-rn\">points out that</a> “Reading Cut essays or watching Netflix documentaries is inherently social. They’re written to be consumed and processed online.” <b>Participating in The Discourse is often </b><a href=\"https://www.garbageday.email/p/taylor-swift-vs-manosphere\"><b>part of the fun</b></a> of the internet, and that means keeping up with whatever we’re Discoursing about today. We feel like we must have an opinion about everything (<a href=\"https://brandons-journal.com/this-years-theme-abide/\">but we don’t</a>). We don’t want to feel left out of the loop, the internet equivalent of fake laughing along with the reference we didn’t get.</p>\n<p>Participating in shared culture is part of fitting in: looking the part, speaking the lingo, getting the references. <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2024/12/10/disruptive-technology-the-answering-machine/\">Josh Lauer writes</a>: “The imperative to participate—as media users, content creators and curators, and members of virtual communities—has become a defining aspect of digital life.” We choose what we do and which cultural and knowledge works we consume in part based on the cultures we consider ourselves part of. <b>But the internet keeps us tuned in closer with the cultural consumption of more people from different parts of our lives, building higher demands to keep up</b> with what all our friends, family, professional contacts, and influencers for our self-selected subcultures are reading, watching, listening to, talking about. Keeping up requires <em>more</em>.</p>\n<p>Our connections become mediated through social features on websites like Goodreads, encouraging us to consume what our friends are. <b>Consumption becomes participation in culture.</b> As Julia Alexander<a href=\"https://posting-nexus.ghost.io/goodreads-challenge-spotify-wrapped-social-media-competition-posting-attention/\"> puts it</a> (emphasis mine):</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I was thinking about the gamification of our leisure time earlier this week while talking to a friend who’s an executive at an entertainment company lamenting that they didn’t have enough time to keep up with any trend over the last couple years let alone new ones. A new superstar actor who debuted in a Netflix movie? Didn’t want to keep up, but the movie was all over Instagram. The latest book flying off the shelves? Not a big reader but their favorite podcaster said it’s what everyone is obsessing over. <b>Connection is consumption, and consumption is quantifiable.</b>”</p></blockquote>\n<p>On the corporate web, the growth mindset has been insinuated into activities we used to do just for fun. Turning leisure activities into obligations stole the pleasure of nonproduction from our free time.</p>\n<h4>Choosing who influences us</h4>\n<p>Adapting to the people “around us” isn’t a bad thing, it’s just something to be aware of: <b>who are we allowing to influence us? </b>Celine Nguyen<a href=\"https://www.personalcanon.com/p/in-praise-of-writing-on-the-internet\"> writes</a> about how we can use the dynamics of influence to act on ourselves by choosing who we spend time around and which rabbit holes we dive down:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“A lot has been written about how the internet radicalizes people. But the same dynamics that turn a slightly lonely young man into a seething misogynist—recommendation algorithms; social contexts that concentrate and intensify discourse—are also the dynamics that turn a young person who “likes reading” into someone who spends a year reading Proust, and then the next two years trying to find friends who want to reread Proust together.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>I’ve chosen to be active in the <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2023/11/30/building-community-out-of-strangers/\">indie web community</a>, an <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2023/06/24/the-indieweb-as-affinity-network/\">affinity network</a> with a shared interest in the open web. I follow lots of other bloggers, participate in the <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Carnival\">IndieWeb Carnival</a>, write about the indie web and cross-post articles to <a href=\"https://news.indieweb.org/\">IndieNews</a>, and attend IndieWeb events. The indie web is interesting to me both at an individual and community level; that means “keeping up” with the indie web means paying attention to what individual people are doing and talking about, as well as the conversations going on in the community. <b>It’s important to me to stay interconnected with what this group is thinking about and reading</b>. I’ve put a lot of thought into building <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2024/03/01/indieweb-interactions-what-builds-connection/\">connections within the indie web</a>, and count participating in community conversations a factor in <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2023/12/18/choosing-between-ideas-for-blog-posts/\">what I choose to write about</a>. I have intentionally chosen how involved I want to be in the indie web community, and <b>I like the places the indie web has taken me</b>.</p>\n<p>I think the indie web is a pretty healthy place to be influenced by others – for me it’s led to cool stuff like incorporating a <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2024/04/26/adding-a-heart-reacji-to-my-wordpress-theme/\">heart reacji</a> on my website after <a href=\"https://www.benji.dog/articles/interactions-or-reactions/\">Benji set it up to share</a> and <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2024/08/30/weeknotes-august-24-30-2024/\">adding series to my site</a> after <a href=\"https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/curating-a-series-of-articles/\">Chris set them up on his</a>. <b>Interactions on the indie web amplify creation, instead of consumption</b>; <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2022/08/07/scenius-recognizes-network-effect-on-creativity/\">the concept of “scenius”</a> describes how network effects can multiply creativity in an area, which I’m applying to the digital space too. <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2024/09/19/long-live-hypertext/\">Hypertext</a>, where the ideas live “<a href=\"https://thejaymo.net/2024/07/07/246-somewhere-inside-the-network/\">somewhere inside the network</a>”, feels like a natural environment for this type of collaborative, community thinking. <strong>The indie web is a group of people I like to think with.</strong></p>\n<h2>How to climb out of the information pit</h2>\n<p><b>The philosophical approach to escaping the endless information pit that is the internet: learn to accept</b><a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2024/10/14/stories-help-us-find-truth-but-theres-a-difference-between-fact-and-fiction/\"> <b>uncertainty</b></a><b>.</b></p>\n<p>Trust yourself to make decisions with imperfect information. Stop looking for<a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2020/12/17/self-sabotaging-success/\"> external validation</a>, and<a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2023/02/20/the-work-is-not-enough/\"> find meaning outside of work</a>. Believe in your skills, your value, and<a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2024/10/13/resilience-builds-on-trust-fascism-on-fear/\"> your ability to adapt</a> to changing situations. Accept that some things, even important things, are<a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2024/10/07/granting-ourselves-grace/\"> out of your control</a>.</p>\n<p>(In case it isn’t clear, I’m talking to myself here ????)</p>\n<p>Learning to live with uncertainty gets at <strong>the foundational fear of wanting to know it will all work out</strong>, but is very hard — probably a life-long endeavor.</p>\n<p><b>More practically, you can change how you read.</b> (I’m using reading as my example because I like reading and don’t like video, but the philosophy applies to both.) This is also hard, but easy in comparison to changing your mindset*. <a href=\"https://makoism.com/holes/\">You have to make yourself put down the shovel, though</a>; the pit is big enough already.</p>\n*(Not that it’s not worth doing the work — it is — but taking tangible action is a good first step ????)<h3>Disrupt the reading environment</h3>\n<p><strong>We must disrupt our patterns of behavior if we truly want to change.</strong> Aline Holzwarth <a href=\"https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/psychology/the-three-laws-of-human-behavior\">describes a law of human behavior</a> that keeps us doing what we’re doing:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“People tend to stick to the status quo unless the forces of friction or fuel push us off of our path; behavior is a function of the person and their environment…”</p></blockquote>\n<p>It might seem like going cold turkey on info is the answer, but the science of behavior change suggests that <b><i>replacing </i></b><b>a bad habit with a better one is often more effective than trying to quit outright</b>.</p>\n<p>Well-intentioned time limits on browsing won’t solve the problem – as <a href=\"https://simone.org/tracking-screen-time/\">Simone points out</a>, “It’s not about how much you use your phone. It’s about whether your phone is a needy, attention-sucking vampire.” And mine is.</p>\n<p>Or, it was.</p>\n<p>In the past few weeks, I’ve changed the way I read so I only have access to higher quality reading material on my phone, which is where I tend to veg and slip into a mindless scroll. <b>I deleted my feed reader app</b>, logged out of BlueSky*, and deleted my microblogging client. Now if I want to read on my phone, I can choose between my Read Later app, books on Libby, or PDFs I’ve saved. I want to break my mental association between phone and brain candy. I’m also keeping books scattered all over my house so it’s <b>as easy to grab a book as my phone</b>.</p>\n*(I can get around being logged out but it interrupts the immediate impulse – my friend suggested that if I <em>really</em> want to make it hard to circumvent myself, I could set up my password manager so I don’t have access to social accounts on mobile… haven’t gotten to that point yet ????)<h3>Separate curation from consumption</h3>\n<p>Rach Smith <a href=\"https://rachsmith.com/subscribe-a-lot-consume-a-little/\">describes their philosophy for deciding what to read</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The way I like to do content consumption is to subscribe to many different sources and then be ruthless about which content I actually choose to consume.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>I like how this blends a diversity of sources with a more constrained amount of reading. To put something like this into practice, <strong>I’m not reading articles when I open them</strong>. Instead, I am trying out splitting my reading time into phases:</p>\n<ol><li>Gather</li>\n<li>Collect</li>\n<li>Curate</li>\n<li>Select</li>\n</ol><p>The key benefit of this, for me, is the emotional separation between the time I open an article and the time I decide whether or not to actually read it. <b>Not reading “in the heat of the moment”</b> makes a big difference for me in being able to let things go.</p>\n<p>It also gives me a mental break to refocus on what <em>I</em> want, what <em>I</em> am interested in. It’s not that everything I read must have an obvious value proposition, but acknowledging that I simply cannot read everything, and some pieces of writing will be more valuable to me than others, though that value may be in terms of connection or entertainment, not “practical” benefit. Because I can see all the options for reading at once, it feels more like I’m selecting what to read than simply keeping up.</p>\n<h4>What this looks like in practice</h4>\n<p>My process is inefficient, but I use that to my advantage:</p>\n<ol><li>Select article in my<a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2023/02/07/what-makes-rss-better-than-social-timelines/\"> feed reader</a></li>\n<li>Open it in my browser</li>\n<li>Save it to my read later app (currently Instapaper)</li>\n<li>(Later, preferably the next day) Curate my read later list by tagging and archiving articles</li>\n<li>(Hopefully!) Select what to read around a question or theme</li>\n</ol><p><b>Each time I interact with an article gives me another chance to decide not to read it.</b> Since my problem is having too many options, that’s great. Articles get culled at every stage.</p>\n<p>I am <b>exploiting my own emotional sense of safety</b> with this process – by saving everything to my Read Later app, I have the assurance that I <i>could </i>go pull something out of the archives if I decide later that it was worth reading after all… but I never do ????</p>\n<p>I don’t always follow the process — if I’m reading an article and want to follow a link in it right away, I’ll do that, that’s how hypertext works — but I’m working on being better about <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2022/06/25/decide-before-doing/\">deciding what I’m doing before I do it</a>.</p>\n<h2>How I’m separating curation from consumption</h2>\n<h3>Phase 1: GATHER by subscribing and browsing</h3>\n<p>I start by defining the area of my attention, the pool of information that I’ll choose from. I cast a wide net across <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/blogroll/\">indie web bloggers</a> and microbloggers and curated email newsletters (most of which I follow <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2023/02/07/what-makes-rss-better-than-social-timelines/\">via RSS</a>). I seek book recommendations from bloggers and on Goodreads, plus I’ve found <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2021/09/17/browsing-is-learning/\">browsing</a> through broad search terms at my local library turns up all manner of intriguing options.</p>\n<h3>Phase 2: COLLECT a “long list”</h3>\n<p>Out of the pool of information I gather, I collect a long list of articles and books that sound interesting. I open any articles that sound interesting from my RSS reader in my browser, and skim link roundups to choose which links I want to evaluate further. Often, I’ll skim the first paragraph or scan the shape of the article to get a feel for how long it is and judge whether or not it might be worth reading. When the same article is recommended by a lot of people I follow, it’s probably worth reading, if not on its own merits to understand what people are thinking about.</p>\n<p>I collect:</p>\n<ul><li>articles in my Read-it-Later app</li>\n<li>book recommendations on my Goodreads “someday maybe” shelf, library “For Later” list, and Libby ebook tags</li>\n<li>PDFs in a library on my desktop (ok realistically I don’t move them from my phone to computer that often)</li>\n</ul><h3>Step 3: CURATE a “short list”</h3>\n<p>Once I’m done collecting options for the day, I’ll <b>pare down the long list into a short list</b>. (Even better if I wait till the next day, but at the end of a gathering phase works too.) For articles in my Read Later app, that means either <b>tagging articles</b> for the short list or <b>archiving </b>ones that I don’t really need to read (inspired by Alex’s<a href=\"https://alexsirac.com/improving-our-relationship-to-news/\"> Improving our relationship to news</a>).</p>\n<p>At this stage, I use length as a proxy for depth and <b>prefer medium to long articles</b> over short pieces – the Read Later app gives me an estimated reading time that’s helpful for comparing options. The exception here is posts by individual bloggers, who often write shorter posts than verbose Substackers.</p>\n<p>As a blogger, another consideration is whether the article’s about something I’d like to write about. A lot of my blogging happens in response to what I read, so <b>choosing what I read is another way of </b><a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2023/05/19/a-note-gathering-and-idea-making-process/\"><b>choosing what I’m going to blog about</b></a>.</p>\n<p>I move books from my Goodreads “someday maybe ” shelf to my “want to read” shelf. I batch library runs for once or twice a month, and think of each pickup as<a href=\"https://notes.tracydurnell.com/categories/reading/\"> a collection</a>. (I don’t expect myself to read every book I borrow.) As I’m choosing which books to request, I <b>think of it as a menu</b> – I want different options for different tastes and mindsets. I try to <b>address a variety of my reading needs: learning, inspiration, entertainment</b>. I don’t want to order a bunch of heavy stuff all at once.</p>\n<a href=\"https://notes.tracydurnell.com/2024/07/11/heavy-on-the.html\"><img src=\"https://tracydurnell.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/library-hoard-July-2024.jpg\" alt=\"stack of library books, many of them comics\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" /></a>a sample <a href=\"https://notes.tracydurnell.com/2024/07/11/heavy-on-the.html\">library haul</a>: two prose books, three art books, a cookbook, and five comics<p>(You’ll notice I don’t have a process yet for sorting and reading PDFs… that’s a spring project ????)</p>\n<h3>Step 4: SELECT what to actually read</h3>\n<p>Finally, I’ll choose from my short list of articles or menu of library books. This lets me decide before I start reading <b>whether I am reading to be social, to learn, or to be entertained</b>.</p>\n<p>As I’m deciding what to read, I try to:</p>\n<ul><li>relate back to my<a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/questions/\"> <b>Big Questions</b></a> and blog posts I’m currently writing</li>\n<li>embrace <b>curiosity and fun</b></li>\n<li>get <b>context and analysis</b> on current events</li>\n<li>keep up on <b>conversations in the indie web</b></li>\n</ul><p>I’ve been working on <strong>listening to my excitement, following wherever whim leads me</strong>. Sometimes that means gambling on a cultural work without doing a ton of research. Earlier this month, I read an interesting quote by Roland Barthes, noticed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pleasure_of_the_Text\">the book it came from</a> had an intriguing title, ordered a used copy on Better World Books, and now I’ve read half of what’s turned out to be a much more philosophical treatise on pleasure than I imagined ???? But I’m glad I didn’t get scared off! The indulgent, uninhibited prose alone is worth the price of entry ????

        "text": "This is part three of a series on tackling wants, managing my media diet, and finding enough. Read the introduction on “the mindset of more.”\nThe Internet feels like an old relative’s hoarder house, the hallways so packed with clutter you can barely squeeze through. At one point they remembered where some of the important things were, but not anymore. You already can’t find anything beneath the junk mail, and the mismatched mass of stuff all blends together into one — at this point you’d be thrilled to uncover their collection of chipped Hummel figurines simply for the sake of coherence — and you also can’t stop them from bringing more shit home.\nI find myself collecting an informational hoard, amassing articles in my read-it-later app and piling books onto my TBR. The more information I’m exposed to, the more I realize how little I know, and the more I feel compelled to patch this deficit. I hunger for the new; even when I have plenty of articles saved to Instapaper, my default action is to gather more. Who knows what I might miss if I don’t check what’s new? What if there’s a better article, a better book, a better explanation to be found?\n\nCurator Hans Ulrich Oberst notes that for most of history, scarcity was the challenge; now, overproduction is. Today, the pace that new content is flung at us means that, without substantial willpower or intentionality, we’re so busy consuming we don’t have time to think. Trying to keep up means we rarely take the time to step back and think about what we’re keeping up with. Dependent on pageviews for advertising revenue, publications pull every trick in the book to steal our attention. My own curiosities are swamped by the neverending pile of information dumped on my mental threshold each day.\nNB: in this post, I’m mostly talking about non-fiction books and articles online, though I also find my phone gets in the way of reading fiction sometimes too!\nOver the past couple years, I’ve tracked everything I read in a day several times. This gave me a better understanding of what I was reading, and how much I could actually read in a day — it’s less than I expected. Depending on length, it might be as few as five articles, or if I spend an entire Saturday lounging around reading the internet, as many as twenty articles. Let’s call it an average of fifteen. This knowledge alone has been enough to jolt me out of reading some stuff that was obviously attention bait – is this worth one of my fifteen reading slots for the day? (Reading for entertainment isn’t bad, I just want to do so intentionally.)\nInformation acts as a modern enchantment, keeping us in its sway. When I decide to read, I instinctively pick up my phone instead of a book. And as much as I think online writing is valuable and important, some writing is higher quality than others. (I don’t mean quality at the prose level, more impact. Because I also get annoyed by fancified writing that overcomplicates itself — I’ve learned to steer clear of literary reviews ????) I seem to gravitate towards the same kind of Substack personal essay, so if I unthinkingly read whatever has emotional pull, when I emerge from the haze, I realize I’ve read several interchangeable vibes pieces that I couldn’t tell you who wrote.\nI want to escape emotional manipulation and choose what I invest my limited time in more intentionally. If I notice I’m interested in a particular topic, I want to seek out and read higher quality material about it – more books! more complicated books! – when I have the mental energy. In essence, I want to replace my “mental junk food” binge habit with more thoughtful reading.\nAs I’ve practiced being more intentional about what I read, I’ve honed in on a few filters for myself:\nThree “rules” for attention\nChoose what to read based on my interest, not “to be an informed person”\nBe skeptical of titles that invoke fear; be wary of articles framed to make me feel superior to others\nPrioritize information that will directly impact my life or community; pay less attention to news outside my control\nI still fall for things that break these rules all the time, but having them has helped me turn down a lot of reading in favor of better options for me.\nWhy we feel the need to consume more\nMy friend pointed out that our appetites developed in an age of scarcity, when we needed to consume as much as we could find, and more information was always better. We weren’t made to resist information, and our brains reward us for feeding ourselves more, even if those intellectual calories turn out to be hollow. In a world of scarcity, easy calories were a better choice than hard-to-get ones — but the information that’s easiest to come by is often the lowest quality, or worse, manipulative.\nUnderstanding the emotional forces that influence what I decide to read is my first step towards asserting control over what information I spend my time and mental energy on.\nInformation makes us feel in control\nHaley Nahman recognizes how our consumption habits assuage our anxiety: “There are infinite resources available to quell our voids.” Having the theoretical ability to have information makes us feel like we need it. Yet our anxiety “isn’t caused by a lack of answers to [our] swirl of questions, but the swirl itself.” I have anxiety, and our modern information system seems tailor-made to feed off and amplify my worries.\nUltimately, the reason we keep gathering information is that we conflate being informed with being in control. With enough knowledge, we’ll never lose our jobs, we’ll keep ourselves and our loved ones safe, we’ll know how to survive if the government really starts rounding up leftists. Knowing what’s going on in D.C. at every moment becomes a way to feel that we are participating, believe that we understand what’s happening, and assure ourselves that we will be able to react to whatever happens.\nGathering information substitutes knowledge for action. In Capitalist Realism, Mark Fisher describes the concept of interpassivity:\n“A film like Wall-E exemplifies what Robert Pfaller has called ‘interpassivity’: the film performs our anticapitalism for us, allowing us to continue to consume with impunity. The role of capitalist ideology is not to make an explicit case for something in the way that propaganda does, but to conceal the fact that the operations of capital do not depend on any sort of subjectively assumed belief.”\nIn essence, consuming content that expresses our desire for change stands in place of acting for change. (I am definitely guilty of this!)\nI find my emotions manipulated into reading things that, frankly, do not matter to my life. They are outside my realm of influence, but I have been carried along into caring about them by headlines that enrage. My emotional energy is expended on things that I cannot control, leaving me less for the things that I could have some influence on.\nWe fear not being enough\nTricia Hersey argues in Rest is Resistance that “Grind culture has placed fear as our only compass and keeps us frozen in a way that is now a habit.”\nAs workers’ skills are devalued, we feel pressure to constantly be learning new ones to make sure we’re still needed by the market. With the rise of the precariat class — and more and more workers becoming part of it — performing knowledge acquisition can become more important than actually learning things (have you visited LinkedIn lately). We lean on book summaries, we listen to audio books on 2x, 3x speed so we can fit in more. Unconsciously, value becomes the key heuristic for any piece of media we engage with. But it’s toxic to expect that every thing we read deliver market-ready insights, an expectation that erodes the perceived worth of any information that isn’t immediately applicable. We don’t feel we have time to wait for insights to arise naturally, but instead feed ourselves as much information as we can. Bread and roses, went the Labor slogan — this mindset says never mind the flowers.\nJohann Hari describes how this feels as a writer:\n“I fattened myself with information every waking hour to make myself a more productive writer, and I had started to think that the way I lived was a bit like the process where, in a factory farm, a foie gras goose is force-fed gross amounts in order to turn its liver into pâté.”\nChris Bailey identifies this as the accomplishment mindset, which “leads us to always want to fill our time with something — and feel guilty when we’re spending our time in a ‘nonoptimal’ way.” At the root of the mindset? “[O]ur relentless pursuit of more.” In Four Thousand Weeks, Oliver Burkeman writes, “The fundamental problem is that this attitude toward time sets up a rigged game in which it’s impossible ever to feel as though you’re doing well enough.”\nTara McMullin hones in on self-worth as the underlying value behind this urge: “We seek validation for our worthiness and usefulness in our families, in our jobs, in our friendships, and even in the quiet moments we call ‘me time.'” More and more, our status – and emotional safety – relies on our online performance to even our offline communities, whether that is via Facebook or LinkedIn.\nCultural consumption is participation\nMuch of what we read is for social reasons. I realized recently that most individual online writing – not just on social media, but on blogs too – is part of oral culture; we are online to be social, even if that sociality is asynchronous. With fewer non-commercial places to gather, we have less opportunity to simply be or do with each other, so we go online and consume together. \nSarah LaBrie points out that “Reading Cut essays or watching Netflix documentaries is inherently social. They’re written to be consumed and processed online.” Participating in The Discourse is often part of the fun of the internet, and that means keeping up with whatever we’re Discoursing about today. We feel like we must have an opinion about everything (but we don’t). We don’t want to feel left out of the loop, the internet equivalent of fake laughing along with the reference we didn’t get.\nParticipating in shared culture is part of fitting in: looking the part, speaking the lingo, getting the references. Josh Lauer writes: “The imperative to participate—as media users, content creators and curators, and members of virtual communities—has become a defining aspect of digital life.” We choose what we do and which cultural and knowledge works we consume in part based on the cultures we consider ourselves part of. But the internet keeps us tuned in closer with the cultural consumption of more people from different parts of our lives, building higher demands to keep up with what all our friends, family, professional contacts, and influencers for our self-selected subcultures are reading, watching, listening to, talking about. Keeping up requires more.\nOur connections become mediated through social features on websites like Goodreads, encouraging us to consume what our friends are. Consumption becomes participation in culture. As Julia Alexander puts it (emphasis mine):\n“I was thinking about the gamification of our leisure time earlier this week while talking to a friend who’s an executive at an entertainment company lamenting that they didn’t have enough time to keep up with any trend over the last couple years let alone new ones. A new superstar actor who debuted in a Netflix movie? Didn’t want to keep up, but the movie was all over Instagram. The latest book flying off the shelves? Not a big reader but their favorite podcaster said it’s what everyone is obsessing over. Connection is consumption, and consumption is quantifiable.”\nOn the corporate web, the growth mindset has been insinuated into activities we used to do just for fun. Turning leisure activities into obligations stole the pleasure of nonproduction from our free time.\nChoosing who influences us\nAdapting to the people “around us” isn’t a bad thing, it’s just something to be aware of: who are we allowing to influence us? Celine Nguyen writes about how we can use the dynamics of influence to act on ourselves by choosing who we spend time around and which rabbit holes we dive down:\n“A lot has been written about how the internet radicalizes people. But the same dynamics that turn a slightly lonely young man into a seething misogynist—recommendation algorithms; social contexts that concentrate and intensify discourse—are also the dynamics that turn a young person who “likes reading” into someone who spends a year reading Proust, and then the next two years trying to find friends who want to reread Proust together.”\nI’ve chosen to be active in the indie web community, an affinity network with a shared interest in the open web. I follow lots of other bloggers, participate in the IndieWeb Carnival, write about the indie web and cross-post articles to IndieNews, and attend IndieWeb events. The indie web is interesting to me both at an individual and community level; that means “keeping up” with the indie web means paying attention to what individual people are doing and talking about, as well as the conversations going on in the community. It’s important to me to stay interconnected with what this group is thinking about and reading. I’ve put a lot of thought into building connections within the indie web, and count participating in community conversations a factor in what I choose to write about. I have intentionally chosen how involved I want to be in the indie web community, and I like the places the indie web has taken me.\nI think the indie web is a pretty healthy place to be influenced by others – for me it’s led to cool stuff like incorporating a heart reacji on my website after Benji set it up to share and adding series to my site after Chris set them up on his. Interactions on the indie web amplify creation, instead of consumption; the concept of “scenius” describes how network effects can multiply creativity in an area, which I’m applying to the digital space too. Hypertext, where the ideas live “somewhere inside the network”, feels like a natural environment for this type of collaborative, community thinking. The indie web is a group of people I like to think with.\nHow to climb out of the information pit\nThe philosophical approach to escaping the endless information pit that is the internet: learn to accept uncertainty.\nTrust yourself to make decisions with imperfect information. Stop looking for external validation, and find meaning outside of work. Believe in your skills, your value, and your ability to adapt to changing situations. Accept that some things, even important things, are out of your control.\n(In case it isn’t clear, I’m talking to myself here ????)\nLearning to live with uncertainty gets at the foundational fear of wanting to know it will all work out, but is very hard — probably a life-long endeavor.\nMore practically, you can change how you read. (I’m using reading as my example because I like reading and don’t like video, but the philosophy applies to both.) This is also hard, but easy in comparison to changing your mindset*. You have to make yourself put down the shovel, though; the pit is big enough already.\n*(Not that it’s not worth doing the work — it is — but taking tangible action is a good first step ????)Disrupt the reading environment\nWe must disrupt our patterns of behavior if we truly want to change. Aline Holzwarth describes a law of human behavior that keeps us doing what we’re doing:\n“People tend to stick to the status quo unless the forces of friction or fuel push us off of our path; behavior is a function of the person and their environment…”\nIt might seem like going cold turkey on info is the answer, but the science of behavior change suggests that replacing a bad habit with a better one is often more effective than trying to quit outright.\nWell-intentioned time limits on browsing won’t solve the problem – as Simone points out, “It’s not about how much you use your phone. It’s about whether your phone is a needy, attention-sucking vampire.” And mine is.\nOr, it was.\nIn the past few weeks, I’ve changed the way I read so I only have access to higher quality reading material on my phone, which is where I tend to veg and slip into a mindless scroll. I deleted my feed reader app, logged out of BlueSky*, and deleted my microblogging client. Now if I want to read on my phone, I can choose between my Read Later app, books on Libby, or PDFs I’ve saved. I want to break my mental association between phone and brain candy. I’m also keeping books scattered all over my house so it’s as easy to grab a book as my phone.\n*(I can get around being logged out but it interrupts the immediate impulse – my friend suggested that if I really want to make it hard to circumvent myself, I could set up my password manager so I don’t have access to social accounts on mobile… haven’t gotten to that point yet ????)Separate curation from consumption\nRach Smith describes their philosophy for deciding what to read:\n“The way I like to do content consumption is to subscribe to many different sources and then be ruthless about which content I actually choose to consume.”\nI like how this blends a diversity of sources with a more constrained amount of reading. To put something like this into practice, I’m not reading articles when I open them. Instead, I am trying out splitting my reading time into phases:\nGather\nCollect\nCurate\nSelect\nThe key benefit of this, for me, is the emotional separation between the time I open an article and the time I decide whether or not to actually read it. Not reading “in the heat of the moment” makes a big difference for me in being able to let things go.\nIt also gives me a mental break to refocus on what I want, what I am interested in. It’s not that everything I read must have an obvious value proposition, but acknowledging that I simply cannot read everything, and some pieces of writing will be more valuable to me than others, though that value may be in terms of connection or entertainment, not “practical” benefit. Because I can see all the options for reading at once, it feels more like I’m selecting what to read than simply keeping up.\nWhat this looks like in practice\nMy process is inefficient, but I use that to my advantage:\nSelect article in my feed reader\nOpen it in my browser\nSave it to my read later app (currently Instapaper)\n(Later, preferably the next day) Curate my read later list by tagging and archiving articles\n(Hopefully!) Select what to read around a question or theme\nEach time I interact with an article gives me another chance to decide not to read it. Since my problem is having too many options, that’s great. Articles get culled at every stage.\nI am exploiting my own emotional sense of safety with this process – by saving everything to my Read Later app, I have the assurance that I could go pull something out of the archives if I decide later that it was worth reading after all… but I never do ????\nI don’t always follow the process — if I’m reading an article and want to follow a link in it right away, I’ll do that, that’s how hypertext works — but I’m working on being better about deciding what I’m doing before I do it.\nHow I’m separating curation from consumption\nPhase 1: GATHER by subscribing and browsing\nI start by defining the area of my attention, the pool of information that I’ll choose from. I cast a wide net across indie web bloggers and microbloggers and curated email newsletters (most of which I follow via RSS). I seek book recommendations from bloggers and on Goodreads, plus I’ve found browsing through broad search terms at my local library turns up all manner of intriguing options.\nPhase 2: COLLECT a “long list”\nOut of the pool of information I gather, I collect a long list of articles and books that sound interesting. I open any articles that sound interesting from my RSS reader in my browser, and skim link roundups to choose which links I want to evaluate further. Often, I’ll skim the first paragraph or scan the shape of the article to get a feel for how long it is and judge whether or not it might be worth reading. When the same article is recommended by a lot of people I follow, it’s probably worth reading, if not on its own merits to understand what people are thinking about.\nI collect:\narticles in my Read-it-Later app\nbook recommendations on my Goodreads “someday maybe” shelf, library “For Later” list, and Libby ebook tags\nPDFs in a library on my desktop (ok realistically I don’t move them from my phone to computer that often)\nStep 3: CURATE a “short list”\nOnce I’m done collecting options for the day, I’ll pare down the long list into a short list. (Even better if I wait till the next day, but at the end of a gathering phase works too.) For articles in my Read Later app, that means either tagging articles for the short list or archiving ones that I don’t really need to read (inspired by Alex’s Improving our relationship to news).\nAt this stage, I use length as a proxy for depth and prefer medium to long articles over short pieces – the Read Later app gives me an estimated reading time that’s helpful for comparing options. The exception here is posts by individual bloggers, who often write shorter posts than verbose Substackers.\nAs a blogger, another consideration is whether the article’s about something I’d like to write about. A lot of my blogging happens in response to what I read, so choosing what I read is another way of choosing what I’m going to blog about.\nI move books from my Goodreads “someday maybe ” shelf to my “want to read” shelf. I batch library runs for once or twice a month, and think of each pickup as a collection. (I don’t expect myself to read every book I borrow.) As I’m choosing which books to request, I think of it as a menu – I want different options for different tastes and mindsets. I try to address a variety of my reading needs: learning, inspiration, entertainment. I don’t want to order a bunch of heavy stuff all at once.\na sample library haul: two prose books, three art books, a cookbook, and five comics(You’ll notice I don’t have a process yet for sorting and reading PDFs… that’s a spring project ????)\nStep 4: SELECT what to actually read\nFinally, I’ll choose from my short list of articles or menu of library books. This lets me decide before I start reading whether I am reading to be social, to learn, or to be entertained.\nAs I’m deciding what to read, I try to:\nrelate back to my Big Questions and blog posts I’m currently writing\nembrace curiosity and fun\nget context and analysis on current events\nkeep up on conversations in the indie web\nI’ve been working on listening to my excitement, following wherever whim leads me. Sometimes that means gambling on a cultural work without doing a ton of research. Earlier this month, I read an interesting quote by Roland Barthes, noticed the book it came from had an intriguing title, ordered a used copy on Better World Books, and now I’ve read half of what’s turned out to be a much more philosophical treatise on pleasure than I imagined ???? But I’m glad I didn’t get scared off! The indulgent, uninhibited prose alone is worth the price of entry ???? While I was looking it up, I saw another book with the same title had a totally bonkers cover, and they had a copy for $5, so I said why not??? I’ve been thinking a lot about how oral culture applies to the internet, so I thought I might re-read Orality and Literacy — when I looked it up, another title popped up that was specifically about oral culture on the internet???? and there was a single used copy left, so I took it as kismet and ordered it too ???? This whole process has felt *alive*. We’ll see how it goes when I’m back to work, but for now I am Digging It.\nI’ve only started using this process over the past few weeks, but so far it’s working almost exactly how I want. This is what I’m trying to manage my information diet, and I can’t promise it’ll work for anyone else — but I know I’m not the only one thinking about what I read right now.\n \nFurther reading:\nRethinking Reading by Steve Makofsky\nIntention economy by Nick Simson\nWe really like personal sites but the internet has been turning into poisonous garbage at an alarming rate by Ním Daghlian\nSocial media, brain rot and the slow death of reading by Mia Levitin (FT) – archive link\n \nSee also:\nThe TBR Stream\n\n This is the (current) last article in a series on the mindset of more.\n\n\n\t\t    Previous: Questioning collections: the emotional weight of uncollecting (Part 2)"

        "text": "En realidad mi español no es muy bueno. Pero es un buen título. Y es bueno practicar español. But English is my best language so I shall endeavor to do that.\nI signed a petition about San Clemente beaches yesterday and was glad to do it. I think about the beach a lot and go as often as is practical. I went yesterday after a drought of several days. I’ve had cold symptoms and was only really strong enough to do programming work, so I took it easy on beach. Going yesterday was wonderful, even if it was short.\nI liked James’ post about automatic creation of image collages. I suspect code like this will help me if I get to doing object detection on my own huge corpus of images of the beach and toy robots.\nCat and Girl’s comic Facts aren’t feelings made me guffaw. The way it uses the word “whimsy” reminds me of my own embrace of whimsy in the year after my mother’s death. To whit: go hard at whimsy. Be goofy. It’s the way to survive. The toy robot collection is about that.\nThis past week I learned about the British Post Office scandal, in which people were convicted of stealing because of accounting software bugs. (via Mark Sutherland who mentioned it in passing in last weekend’s morning’s IndieWeb event). I learned the term “moral crumple zones” a few weeks ago and this certainly is that. When computers fail, someone must be blamed. Ultimately someone must be held responsible. All the more reason we ought to understand what computers do.\nThis is also an implicit dig at LLM-based software that we have no idea how it works. If we get a result from something, we ought to be able to audit how it got to that result. If we don’t then it’s indistinguishable from magic. Financial accounting is not magic.\nI am considering adding some kind of emoji reactions to posts and comments here. I am skeptical. But if I do it it’ll be using things like this and this.\nMatt Haughey wrote Embrace The Weird and it was inspiring. It’s in the tradition of other favorite aphorisms from people I have an esteem for, most particularly Bruce Sterling’s “Follow Your Weird” from “The Wonderful Power of Storytelling” Computer Game Developers Conference, March 1991 (San Jose CA), which I stashed some time back here.\nFollow your weird, ladies and gentlemen. Forget trying to pass for normal. Follow your geekdom. Embrace your nerditude. In the immortal words of Lafcadio Hearn, a geek of incredible obscurity whose work is still in print after a hundred years, “woo the muse of the odd.” A good science fiction story is not a “good story” with a polite whiff of rocket fuel in it. A good science fiction story is something that knows it is science fiction and plunges through that and comes roaring out of the other side. Computer entertainment should not be more like movies, it shouldn’t be more like books, it should be more like computer entertainment, SO MUCH MORE LIKE COMPUTER ENTERTAINMENT THAT IT RIPS THROUGH THE LIMITS AND IS SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE TO IGNORE!\n“Woo the muse of the odd” is another quite good one but I don’t ever really think of that one.\n“When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro” is from Hunter S. Thompson’s Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas book.\nIncidentally, we can’t stop here, this is bat countryAdditionally, I am a big fan of AAAFNRAA, which I blogged on June 9, 2001 and is still stuck on me, along with Frank Zappa.\nAAAFNRAA — Anything, anytime, anywhere, for no reason at all.\nAdmittedly, maybe whimsy has been with me all along, and what I needed to do after my mother’s death was remember that it was with me.\nWOO THE MUSE OF THE ODD"

        "html": "<p>The Open Heart Protocol is a simple way to add anonymous reactions to your blog, developed by <a href=\"https://muan.co/\">Mu-An Chiou</a>. (I’ll say simple, <a href=\"https://www.benji.dog/articles/interactions-or-reactions/\">with the help of Benji</a> — my eyes glossed over at the <a href=\"https://openheart.fyi/\">actual protocol page</a>, short though it may be.) I added it to my site this week, so anyone can “heart” a post. Benji set up some other emoji options but I’m going to keep it simple for now and start with only a heart.</p>\n<p>This came out of the conversation the IndieWeb’s been having about <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2024/03/01/indieweb-interactions-what-builds-connection\">casual interactions</a>. The Open Heart Protocol adds an easy option for readers to react to a post without having to comment or send a Webmention*. I like when other people’s websites have similar functionality — sometimes I don’t have a response so it’s nice when there’s another means to show appreciation.</p>\n*(I recognize it’s possible for people to send <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/reacji\">emoji reactions</a> via Webmention, but a) <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2024/04/22/webbing-the-indieweb/\">not everyone has a website</a>, b) not everyone uses Webmentions, c) this is way easier and faster than sending a Webmention, and d) there are social forces that may discourage using Webmentions for very small interactions like this.)<p>On social media, likes and reactions can influence people to post differently, seeking reactions. I doubt that adding this heart feature will make me feel any pressure since I don’t get a notification — I’ll just notice it the next time I go back to that post, which could be the next day or months later. I write often enough and about such a broad range of topics, I’d naturally expect some to be more interesting to other people, and not getting anonymous likes on a post I wrote for myself isn’t going to deter me from writing more things for myself. The indie web is also small enough that I’ve been trained not to expect a ton of feedback on anything I publish here.</p>\n<p>Since leaving a heart is anonymous, there’s no social pressure for any reader to “be seen” liking something. In that sense it’s not a two-way “relationship building” feature, but not everything needs to be. We can be <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2023/11/30/building-community-out-of-strangers/\">friendly strangers</a> — driving, we’ve got the courtesy wave, online, we have reacjis ????</p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<h2>How I added Open Heart Protocol to my theme</h2>\n<h3>What code I added</h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.benji.dog/articles/interactions-or-reactions/\">Benji’s code</a>, there’s a spot that needs to be filled in with the link to the item being hearted. That URL must reflect the actual post, not just the overall domain — my first attempt ran into this problem ???? I didn’t know how to do that in WordPress, but Benji pointed me the right direction: you can call the post’s permalink from inside the theme.</p>\n<p>What I got working to call the permalink was* (key section bolded):<br /><code>&lt;open-heart href=\"https://corazon.sploot.com?id=<strong>&lt;?php echo esc_url( get_permalink( $post_id )); ?&gt;</strong>\" emoji=\"❤️\"&gt;❤️&lt;/open-heart&gt;</code></p>\n*(People who know what they’re doing, please tell me if I’ve done something terribly wrong here ???? I just tried different options I found until it worked!)<p>All together with the stuff that actually makes it run, the code block for the heart looks like this (copied from Benji aside from updating the ID):<br /><code>&lt;open-heart href=\"https://corazon.sploot.com?id=&lt;?php echo esc_url( get_permalink( $post_id )); ?&gt;\" emoji=\"❤️\"&gt;❤️&lt;/open-heart&gt;<br />\n&lt;!-- load webcomponent --&gt;<br />\n&lt;script src=\"https://unpkg.com/open-heart-element\" type=\"module\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />\n&lt;!-- when the webcomponent loads, fetch the current counts for that page --&gt;<br />\n&lt;script&gt;<br />\nwindow.customElements.whenDefined('open-heart').then(() =&gt; {<br />\nfor (const oh of document.querySelectorAll('open-heart')) {<br />\noh.getCount()<br />\n}<br />\n})<br />\n// refresh component after click<br />\nwindow.addEventListener('open-heart', e =&gt; {<br />\ne &amp;&amp; e.target &amp;&amp; e.target.getCount &amp;&amp; e.target.getCount()<br />\n})<br />\n&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>\n<h3>Where I put the code</h3>\n<p>First I had to decide <strong>where I wanted the heart to appear on the post page</strong>. I tried adding the heart to the footer but it looked bad and like it was going to be a pain to style. I ultimately added it to the post header meta information, next to the permalink and link to the comments section. Every theme is different, so you may want to put yours somewhere else. For me, that spot was easy to add to within my theme. (I’m using a personal child theme of the WordPress theme Twenty Twenty.)</p>\n<p>You can edit your theme directly through the web interface by navigating to Appearance &gt; Theme File Editor. The file to modify is <strong>template-tags.php</strong>, which is under the folder “inc.” Make sure your child theme is selected in the upper right dropdown (<em>unless it doesn’t work in your child theme, then do it in the main theme and remember you’ll have to add the code again whenever you update your theme *sad trombone* It didn’t work in my child theme, so I made the change in both places</em> ????‍♀️)</p>\n<p>I snuck it in as an additional list item “after” comments, here (in the Twenty Twenty theme v2.6, this starts on line 453 of the template-tags file):</p>\n<p><code>// Comments link <strong>AND Open Heart Protocol .</strong><br />\nif ( in_array( 'comments', $post_meta, true ) &amp;&amp; ! post_password_required() &amp;&amp; ( comments_open() || get_comments_number() ) ) {<br />\n$has_meta = true;<br />\n?&gt;<br />\n&lt;li class=\"post-comment-link meta-wrapper\"&gt;<br />\n&lt;span class=\"meta-icon\"&gt;<br />\n&lt;?php twentytwenty_the_theme_svg( 'comment' ); ?&gt;<br />\n&lt;/span&gt;<br />\n&lt;span class=\"meta-text\"&gt;<br />\n&lt;?php comments_popup_link(); ?&gt;<br />\n&lt;/span&gt;<br />\n&lt;/li&gt;<br /><strong>&lt;li class=\"post-heart meta-wrapper\"&gt;</strong><strong><br />\n&lt;open-heart href=\"https://corazon.sploot.com?id=&lt;?php echo esc_url( get_permalink( $post_id )); ?&gt;\" emoji=\"❤️\"&gt;❤️&lt;/open-heart&gt;</strong><strong><br />\n&lt;!-- load webcomponent --&gt;</strong><strong><br />\n&lt;script src=\"https://unpkg.com/open-heart-element\" type=\"module\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</strong><strong><br />\n&lt;!-- when the webcomponent loads, fetch the current counts for that page --&gt;</strong><strong><br />\n&lt;script&gt;</strong><strong><br />\nwindow.customElements.whenDefined('open-heart').then(() =&gt; {</strong><strong><br />\nfor (const oh of document.querySelectorAll('open-heart')) {</strong><strong><br />\noh.getCount()</strong><strong><br />\n}</strong><strong><br />\n})</strong><strong><br />\n// refresh component after click</strong><strong><br />\nwindow.addEventListener('open-heart', e =&gt; {</strong><strong><br />\ne &amp;&amp; e.target &amp;&amp; e.target.getCount &amp;&amp; e.target.getCount()</strong><strong><br />\n})</strong><strong><br />\n&lt;/script&gt;</strong><strong><br />\n&lt;/li&gt;</strong></code></p>\n<p>(If you wanted to put the heart in the post footer instead, I believe that would be in the file content.php in the folder “template-parts,” near the bottom post meta.)</p>\n<h2>Styling my heart</h2>\n<p>Benji provided some starter CSS, which I modified slightly to better match my own theme. I took away the border that signals it’s a button, so it may be a somewhat invisible tool… except that social media has trained us on these icons as feedback mechanisms, so if people see it, I think they’ll know what it is. Also, it’s an experiment, so it’s ok if I need to make some changes to make it work better!</p>\n<p>Here’s the styling that I added to my theme using Customize &gt; Additional CSS:</p>\n<p><code>/* open heart protocol */<br />\nopen-heart {<br />\nborder: 0;<br />\nmargin-right:1em;<br />\nopacity:0.75;<br />\n}<br />\nopen-heart:not([disabled]):hover,<br />\nopen-heart:not([disabled]):focus {<br />\nborder: 0;<br />\ncursor: pointer;<br />\nopacity:1;<br />\n}<br />\nopen-heart[disabled] {<br />\ncursor: not-allowed;<br />\n}<br />\nopen-heart[count]:not([count=\"0\"])::after {<br />\ncontent: \" \"attr(count);<br />\n}</code></p>",

I doubt that adding this heart feature will make me feel any pressure since I don’t get a notification — I’ll just notice it the next time I go back to that post, which could be the next day or months later. I write often enough and about such a broad range of topics, I’d naturally expect some to be more interesting to other people, and not getting anonymous likes on a post I wrote for myself isn’t going to deter me from writing more things for myself. The indie web is also small enough that I’ve been trained not to expect a ton of feedback on anything I publish here.\nSince leaving a heart is anonymous, there’s no social pressure for any reader to “be seen” liking something. In that sense it’s not a two-way “relationship building” feature, but not everything needs to be. We can be friendly strangers — driving, we’ve got the courtesy wave, online, we have reacjis ????\n\nHow I added Open Heart Protocol to my theme\nWhat code I added\nIn Benji’s code, there’s a spot that needs to be filled in with the link to the item being hearted. That URL must reflect the actual post, not just the overall domain — my first attempt ran into this problem ???? I didn’t know how to do that in WordPress, but Benji pointed me the right direction: you can call the post’s permalink from inside the theme.\nWhat I got working to call the permalink was* (key section bolded):\n<open-heart href=\"https://corazon.sploot.com?id=<?php echo esc_url( get_permalink( $post_id )); ?>\" emoji=\"❤️\">❤️</open-heart>\n*(People who know what they’re doing, please tell me if I’ve done something terribly wrong here ???? I just tried different options I found until it worked!)All together with the stuff that actually makes it run, the code block for the heart looks like this (copied from Benji aside from updating the ID):\n<open-heart href=\"https://corazon.sploot.com?id=<?php echo esc_url( get_permalink( $post_id )); ?>\" emoji=\"❤️\">❤️</open-heart>\n\n<!-- load webcomponent -->\n\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/open-heart-element\" type=\"module\"></script>\n\n<!-- when the webcomponent loads, fetch the current counts for that page -->\n\n<script>\n\nwindow.customElements.whenDefined('open-heart').then(() => {\n\nfor (const oh of document.querySelectorAll('open-heart')) {\n\noh.getCount()\n\n}\n\n})\n\n// refresh component after click\n\nwindow.addEventListener('open-heart', e => {\n\ne && e.target && e.target.getCount && e.target.getCount()\n\n})\n\n</script>\nWhere I put the code\nFirst I had to decide where I wanted the heart to appear on the post page. I tried adding the heart to the footer but it looked bad and like it was going to be a pain to style. I ultimately added it to the post header meta information, next to the permalink and link to the comments section. Every theme is different, so you may want to put yours somewhere else. For me, that spot was easy to add to within my theme. (I’m using a personal child theme of the WordPress theme Twenty Twenty.)\nYou can edit your theme directly through the web interface by navigating to Appearance > Theme File Editor. The file to modify is template-tags.php, which is under the folder “inc.” Make sure your child theme is selected in the upper right dropdown (unless it doesn’t work in your child theme, then do it in the main theme and remember you’ll have to add the code again whenever you update your theme *sad trombone* It didn’t work in my child theme, so I made the change in both places ????‍♀️)\nI snuck it in as an additional list item “after” comments, here (in the Twenty Twenty theme v2.6, this starts on line 453 of the template-tags file):\n// Comments link AND Open Heart Protocol .\n\nif ( in_array( 'comments', $post_meta, true ) && ! post_password_required() && ( comments_open() || get_comments_number() ) ) {\n\n$has_meta = true;\n\n?>\n\n<li class=\"post-comment-link meta-wrapper\">\n\n<span class=\"meta-icon\">\n\n<?php twentytwenty_the_theme_svg( 'comment' ); ?>\n\n</span>\n\n<span class=\"meta-text\">\n\n<?php comments_popup_link(); ?>\n\n</span>\n\n</li>\n<li class=\"post-heart meta-wrapper\">\n\n<open-heart href=\"https://corazon.sploot.com?id=<?php echo esc_url( get_permalink( $post_id )); ?>\" emoji=\"❤️\">❤️</open-heart>\n\n<!-- load webcomponent -->\n\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/open-heart-element\" type=\"module\"></script>\n\n<!-- when the webcomponent loads, fetch the current counts for that page -->\n\n<script>\n\nwindow.customElements.whenDefined('open-heart').then(() => {\n\nfor (const oh of document.querySelectorAll('open-heart')) {\n\noh.getCount()\n\n}\n\n})\n\n// refresh component after click\n\nwindow.addEventListener('open-heart', e => {\n\ne && e.target && e.target.getCount && e.target.getCount()\n\n})\n\n</script>\n\n</li>\n(If you wanted to put the heart in the post footer instead, I believe that would be in the file content.php in the folder “template-parts,” near the bottom post meta.)\nStyling my heart\nBenji provided some starter CSS, which I modified slightly to better match my own theme. I took away the border that signals it’s a button, so it may be a somewhat invisible tool… except that social media has trained us on these icons as feedback mechanisms, so if people see it, I think they’ll know what it is. Also, it’s an experiment, so it’s ok if I need to make some changes to make it work better!\nHere’s the styling that I added to my theme using Customize > Additional CSS:\n/* open heart protocol */\n\nopen-heart {\n\nborder: 0;\n\nmargin-right:1em;\n\nopacity:0.75;\n\n}\n\nopen-heart:not([disabled]):hover,\n\nopen-heart:not([disabled]):focus {\n\nborder: 0;\n\ncursor: pointer;\n\nopacity:1;\n\n}\n\nopen-heart[disabled] {\n\ncursor: not-allowed;\n\n}\n\nopen-heart[count]:not([count=\"0\"])::after {\n\ncontent: \" \"attr(count);\n\n}"

That means, that I now have this information structured in a way, that I can analyse it. So I decided to try to analyse the movies that I watched. Especially since I think this was the year that I watched more movies, than I normally do.</p>\n<p>Also, my blogging platform does allow for using the Jupyter Notebooks as one of the blog posts formats. This and the corresponding book analysis could be a good test if this is something, that I could be including more frequently on my blog. I don't even know, how this post will look in the end.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3>Data Preparation<a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/2024/01/analysis-of-movies-i-watched/#Data-Preparation\">¶</a>\n</h3>\n\n\n\n\n\nIn [1]:\n\n\n<pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>requests</span>\n<span>import</span> <span>collections</span>\n<span>import</span> <span>geopandas</span>\n<span>import</span> <span>pandas</span>\n<span>import</span> <span>mf2py</span>\n<span>from</span> <span>shapely.geometry</span> <span>import</span> <span>Polygon</span><span>,</span> <span>MultiPolygon</span>\n<span>import</span> <span>math</span>\n</pre>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn [2]:\n\n\n<pre><span></span><span>movie_data</span> <span>=</span> <span>requests</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>\"http://0.0.0.0:8000/movies-and-series/\"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>text</span>\n<span>movie_data_microformats</span> <span>=</span> <span>mf2py</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>movie_data</span><span>[</span><span>movie_data</span><span>.</span><span>index</span><span>(</span><span>'&lt;h3&gt;Movies&lt;/h3&gt;'</span><span>):</span><span>movie_data</span><span>.</span><span>index</span><span>(</span><span>'&lt;h4&gt;2022-12&lt;/h4&gt;'</span><span>)],</span> <span>html_parser</span> <span>=</span> <span>\"lxml\"</span><span>)</span>\n</pre>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3>Data Analysis<a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/2024/01/analysis-of-movies-i-watched/#Data-Analysis\">¶</a>\n</h3>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h4>Number of Movies<a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/2024/01/analysis-of-movies-i-watched/#Number-of-Movies\">¶</a>\n</h4>\n\n\n\n\n\nIn [3]:\n\n\n<pre><span></span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>movie_data_microformats</span><span>[</span><span>'items'</span><span>])</span>\n</pre>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut[3]:\n\n<pre>42</pre>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I have watched 42 movies in the last year.</p>\n<p>This is the first full year, that I kept data off. But I am still sure, that I watched more movies than any year in recent years. I don't have the memory to compare this with my younger years.</p>\n<p>I think the reason for this way, that towards the end of the year, I have added the visit to the cinema as the accepted procrastination methods. So if I was not in the mode to do, what I wanted to do, visit to the cinema was a way to avoid this. And once I started to visit cinemas more, I saw more and more movies, that I wanted to watch.

They are part of the European cinema network. They also organise movie screening at the castle each summer.</li>\n<li>Cankarjev dom is not actually a cinema, but it is a main city cultural place. They do host the Liffe movie festival and have the Liffe after Liffe program, which I had last year. They pick six movies from the Liffe festival and then screen one per month in the first half of a year.</li>\n<li>Cineplexx is a cinema about 10 minutes by foot from my home. They mostly screen the Slovenian and popular American movies.</li>\n<li>Kino Bežigrad is usually screening popular American movies. But then it also participates as a venue in different movie festivals and hosts different thematic events, like Japanese movies week or similar. They also have movie watching from cars and in the pools, but I never went to any of them.</li>\n<li>Kinoteka is mostly screening the non-current movies. Though the had the LGBT movie festival this year, and I watched one of the this year movies during it.</li>\n</ul><p>I have to admit, that with my the convenience wins a lot of time. I would give priority to the movies, that I want to see. But if the movie is played in the multiple cinemas, a lot of times the more convenient cinema would win. I am trying to change that.</p>\n<p>I am also aware, how much the different events effect this. I would not have Kinodvor that high without their summer screening at the castle and I would not have Cankarjev Dom and Bežigrad lower or non-existent without the Liffe festival. I guess they know what they are doing to bring people to the cinema.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, it was in the Cineplexx, where I had the experience to having the whole place for myself. I was the only one watching a specific movie for this showing. Felt a bit guilt of them having to play it just for me.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\nIn [12]:\n\n\n<pre><span></span><span>pandas</span><span>.</span><span>DataFrame</span><span>(</span><span>collections</span><span>.</span><span>Counter</span><span>([</span>\n    <span>movie_location_map</span><span>[</span><span>movie</span><span>[</span><span>'properties'</span><span>][</span><span>\"location\"</span><span>][</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>\"https://\"</span><span>,</span> <span>\"\"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>\"www.\"</span><span>,</span> <span>\"\"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>\"/\"</span><span>)[</span><span>0</span><span>]][</span><span>1</span><span>]</span>\n    <span>for</span> <span>movie</span> <span>in</span> <span>movie_data_microformats</span><span>[</span><span>\"items\"</span><span>]</span>\n    <span>if</span> <span>movie_location_map</span><span>[</span><span>movie</span><span>[</span><span>'properties'</span><span>][</span><span>\"location\"</span><span>][</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>\"https://\"</span><span>,</span> <span>\"\"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>\"www.\"</span><span>,</span> <span>\"\"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>\"/\"</span><span>)[</span><span>0</span><span>]][</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>\"Streaming\"</span>\n<span>])</span><span>.</span><span>most_common</span><span>(),</span> <span>columns</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>\"Streaming Service\"</span><span>,</span> <span>\"Count\"</span><span>])</span>\n</pre>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut[12]:\n\n\nStreaming Service\nCount\n0\nCrunchyroll\n2\n1\nNetflix\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>When I talk about movies and series at work, it seems all they watch is what is available on the streaming services.

I have a very strong recency bias, when it comes to movies - but then I expected that.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h4>Languages the Movies I Watched were in<a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/2024/01/analysis-of-movies-i-watched/#Languages-the-Movies-I-Watched-were-in\">¶</a>\n</h4>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I use media for language learning, so I keep track of the languages, that the movies were originally in and in which did I watched me. While movies are usually not the media I normally choose for this, I guess keeping track of that had become a habit.</p>\n<p>For cinema movies, I generally take the language from their site. For the non-cinema movies, I take the language data from the IMDB. Not that the later is very... representative of what I want to track. For example, for the Italian movie <a class=\"u-watch-of\" href=\"https://www.liffe.si/urnik_2023/Film.aspx?idF=3536\" lang=\"it\" xml:lang=\"it\">Rapito</a> (Kidnapped) had Italian as the main language. So the cinema page lists Italian as the language. The <a class=\"u-watch-of\" href=\"https://www.liffe.si/urnik_2023/Film.aspx?idF=3536\">IMDB site of the same movie</a> lists the Italian, Hebrew, and Latin - which were all the languages used in the movie.</p>\n<p>In same cases, I would include multiple languages for the movie, since multiple have substantial role and it would not be the same movie, if everything was in the same language. One that example is <a class=\"u-watch-of\" href=\"https://www.cineplexx.si/movie/varuhi-formule/\" lang=\"sr\" xml:lang=\"sr\">Čuvari formule</a> (Guardians of the Formula). It is a very subjective line to draw.</p>\n<p>But I guess it is easier to just list all of them. And I guess I would need to be more careful of this in the future and not just copy them blindly?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\nIn [16]:\n\n\n<pre><span></span><span>movies_lang</span> <span>=</span> <span>collections</span><span>.</span><span>Counter</span><span>(</span>\n    <span>sum</span><span>([</span>\n        <span>movie</span><span>[</span><span>'properties'</span><span>][</span><span>\"dub\"</span><span>][</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>\", \"</span><span>)</span> \n        <span>if</span> <span>\"dub\"</span> <span>in</span> <span>movie</span><span>[</span><span>'properties'</span><span>]</span>\n        <span>else</span> <span>movie</span><span>[</span><span>'properties'</span><span>][</span><span>'language'</span><span>][</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>\", \"</span><span>)</span> \n        <span>for</span> <span>movie</span> <span>in</span> <span>movie_data_microformats</span><span>[</span><span>\"items\"</span><span>]</span>\n    <span>],</span> <span>[])</span>\n<span>)</span>\n<span>len</span><span>(</span><span>movies_lang</span><span>)</span>\n</pre>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut[16]:\n\n<pre>16</pre>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn [17]:\n\n\n<pre><span></span><span>pandas</span><span>.</span><span>DataFrame</span><span>(</span><span>movies_lang</span><span>.</span><span>most_common</span><span>(),</span> <span>columns</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>\"Language\"</span><span>,</span> <span>\"Number of Movies\"</span><span>])</span>\n</pre>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut[17]:\n\n\nLanguage\nNumber of Movies\n0\nEnglish\n24\n1\nFrench\n7\n2\nJapanese\n6\n3\nGerman\n3\n4\nDanish\n2\n5\nSlovenian\n2\n6\nDzongkha\n2\n7\nItalian\n2\n8\nSerbian\n1\n9\nFinish\n1\n10\nCroatian\n1\n11\nRomanian\n1\n12\nHungarian\n1\n13\nCatalan\n1\n14\nSpanish\n1\n15\nKorean\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn [18]:\n\n\n<pre><span></span><span>pandas</span><span>.</span><span>DataFrame</span><span>(</span>\n    <span>movies_lang</span><span>.</span><span>most_common</span><span>(),</span> <span>columns</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>\"Language\"</span><span>,</span> <span>\"Number of Movies\"</span><span>]</span>\n<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>sort_values</span><span>(</span><span>by</span><span>=</span><span>\"Number of Movies\"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>plot</span><span>(</span><span>kind</span><span>=</span><span>\"barh\"</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>=</span><span>\"Language\"</span><span>)</span>\n</pre>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut[18]:\n\n<pre>&lt;Axes: ylabel='Language'&gt;</pre>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Over half of the movies that I watched were in English.

On the end I watched it in Slovenian, and found out that the original was in English. Not sure why, but I guess it was the whole war thing going on? Hard to film there and hard to find the voice actors with the language skills elsewhere?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h4>Countries the Movies were Associated with<a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/2024/01/analysis-of-movies-i-watched/#Countries-the-Movies-were-Associated-with\">¶</a>\n</h4>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I am actually not sure, how they decide which country the movie is from. The short research seems to indicate, that it is the places, where productions houses have their headquarters? And it might have something to do with financing? Not sure about the last part. If it is in this direction, it is a bit of a stupid metric?</p>\n<p>Still, I was interested in the predominance of the English speaking films in the previous section. So I wanted to see also the countries, from where these movies were from.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h5>Preparing the Country Data<a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/2024/01/analysis-of-movies-i-watched/#Preparing-the-Country-Data\">¶</a>\n</h5>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In order to to this, I first want to make a couple of correction to the maps data. For example, the Asian map looks weird without the Russian and the European looks weird with it. Even though I do count Russian as part of Europe, I am visualising it as part of Asia for the aesthetics purposes.</p>\n<p>Also, I needed to remove a couple of islands from some countries for the purpose of aesthetics.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\nIn [36]:\n\n\n<pre><span></span><span>countries</span> <span>=</span> <span>geopandas</span><span>.</span><span>read_file</span><span>(</span><span>geopandas</span><span>.</span><span>datasets</span><span>.</span><span>get_path</span><span>(</span><span>\"naturalearth_lowres\"</span><span>))</span>\n</pre>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<pre>/tmp/ipykernel_26224/1046189302.py:1: FutureWarning: The geopandas.dataset module is deprecated and will be removed in GeoPandas 1.0.

countries. That makes is what... a bit above 10% of all countries. Still the US and UK dominate the charts.</p>\n<p>Also from the map it can be clearly seen, that I have a string northern hemisphere bias. I generally do not try to watch a varied movies. I watch the movies, that I think I will like based on the description and maybe trailer. But from a lot of parts of the world, they are only bringing the movies with romance or living situation (what is book world would be described as literary book). Something, that I usually avoid.</p>\n<p>Though I did enjoy the two Bhutan movies I watched, even though they could be described as the living situation ones. But I would consider both of the comedy. Especially <a class=\"u-watch-of\" href=\"https://www.liffe.si/urnik_2023/Film.aspx?idF=3607\">The Monk and the Gun</a>.

        "text": "Analysis of the Movies I Watched¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe conversation about movies microformats last month made me change my watched movies list in a way to include them. That means, that I now have this information structured in a way, that I can analyse it. So I decided to try to analyse the movies that I watched. Especially since I think this was the year that I watched more movies, than I normally do.\nAlso, my blogging platform does allow for using the Jupyter Notebooks as one of the blog posts formats. This and the corresponding book analysis could be a good test if this is something, that I could be including more frequently on my blog. I don't even know, how this post will look in the end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Preparation¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn [1]:\n\n\nimport requests\nimport collections\nimport geopandas\nimport pandas\nimport mf2py\nfrom shapely.geometry import Polygon, MultiPolygon\nimport math\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn [2]:\n\n\nmovie_data = requests.get(\"http://0.0.0.0:8000/movies-and-series/\").text\nmovie_data_microformats = mf2py.parse(movie_data[movie_data.index('<h3>Movies</h3>'):movie_data.index('<h4>2022-12</h4>')], html_parser = \"lxml\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Analysis¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Movies¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn [3]:\n\n\nlen(movie_data_microformats['items'])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut[3]:\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have watched 42 movies in the last year.\nThis is the first full year, that I kept data off. But I am still sure, that I watched more movies than any year in recent years. I don't have the memory to compare this with my younger years.\nI think the reason for this way, that towards the end of the year, I have added the visit to the cinema as the accepted procrastination methods. So if I was not in the mode to do, what I wanted to do, visit to the cinema was a way to avoid this. And once I started to visit cinemas more, I saw more and more movies, that I wanted to watch. I still have one on the list from the last year, that is already in the cinema.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlaces I Watched Them¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the previous sections, I have mentioned that I have started to go to cinema more frequently. I do keep track of where I watch a specific movie, so it is possible to see this effect as well. I do it by saving the link to it, to I will need to parse it from the URL of each movie.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn [4]:\n\n\nmovie_location_map = {\n    \"liffe.si\": [\"Cinema\", \"Liffe\"],\n    \"cineplexx.si\": [\"Cinema\", \"Cineplexx\"],\n    \"kinodvor.org\": [\"Cinema\", \"Kinodvor\"],\n    \"cd-cc.si\": [\"Cinema\", \"Cankarjev Dom\"],\n    \"kinoteka.si\": [\"Cinema\", \"Kinoteka\"],\n    \"kino-bezigrad.si\": [\"Cinema\", \"Kino Bežigrad\"],\n    \"netflix.com\": [\"Streaming\", \"Netflix\"],\n    \"plus.cobiss.net\": [\"DVD\", \"Library\"],\n    \"crunchyroll.com\": [\"Streaming\", \"Crunchyroll\"],\n    \"instagram.com\": [\"Event\", \"DIH\"], # Only because I know which movie this is\n    \"theoutmuseum.org\": [\"Internet\"],\n    \"DVD\": [\"DVD\"]\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn [5]:\n\n\nmovies_locations = pandas.DataFrame.from_records(\n    collections.Counter([\n        movie_location_map[movie['properties'][\"location\"][0].replace(\"https://\", \"\").replace(\"www.\", \"\").split(\"/\")[0]][0]\n        for movie in movie_data_microformats[\"items\"]\n    ]).most_common(), columns = [\"Type of Location\", \"Count\"]\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn [6]:\n\n\nmovies_locations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut[6]:\n\n\nType of Location\nCount\n0\nCinema\n34\n1\nStreaming\n4\n2\nDVD\n2\n3\nEvent\n1\n4\nInternet\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn [7]:\n\n\nmovies_locations.sort_values(by=\"Count\").plot(kind = \"barh\", x=0, y=1, legend = False, color=\"blue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut[7]:\n\n<Axes: ylabel='Type of Location'>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have to admit, I knew I watched a lot of movies in the cinema.

They are part of the European cinema network. They also organise movie screening at the castle each summer.\nCankarjev dom is not actually a cinema, but it is a main city cultural place. They do host the Liffe movie festival and have the Liffe after Liffe program, which I had last year. They pick six movies from the Liffe festival and then screen one per month in the first half of a year.\nCineplexx is a cinema about 10 minutes by foot from my home. They mostly screen the Slovenian and popular American movies.\nKino Bežigrad is usually screening popular American movies. But then it also participates as a venue in different movie festivals and hosts different thematic events, like Japanese movies week or similar. They also have movie watching from cars and in the pools, but I never went to any of them.\nKinoteka is mostly screening the non-current movies. Though the had the LGBT movie festival this year, and I watched one of the this year movies during it.\nI have to admit, that with my the convenience wins a lot of time. I would give priority to the movies, that I want to see. But if the movie is played in the multiple cinemas, a lot of times the more convenient cinema would win. I am trying to change that.\nI am also aware, how much the different events effect this. I would not have Kinodvor that high without their summer screening at the castle and I would not have Cankarjev Dom and Bežigrad lower or non-existent without the Liffe festival. I guess they know what they are doing to bring people to the cinema.\nOn the other hand, it was in the Cineplexx, where I had the experience to having the whole place for myself. I was the only one watching a specific movie for this showing. Felt a bit guilt of them having to play it just for me.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn [12]:\n\n\npandas.DataFrame(collections.Counter([\n    movie_location_map[movie['properties'][\"location\"][0].replace(\"https://\", \"\").replace(\"www.\", \"\").split(\"/\")[0]][1]\n    for movie in movie_data_microformats[\"items\"]\n    if movie_location_map[movie['properties'][\"location\"][0].replace(\"https://\", \"\").replace(\"www.\", \"\").split(\"/\")[0]][0] == \"Streaming\"\n]).most_common(), columns = [\"Streaming Service\", \"Count\"])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut[12]:\n\n\nStreaming Service\nCount\n0\nCrunchyroll\n2\n1\nNetflix\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I talk about movies and series at work, it seems all they watch is what is available on the streaming services. Usually Netflix. So I could so also the analysis of the streaming services, and you can see that I did not use it much for movie watching.\nHonestly, if I was not borrowing the Netflix password from somebody in my household, I don't think I would watch that either. Don't watch enough to b worth the subscription.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYears, the Movies I Watched were Produced¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI can also analyse how much of a recent bias to I have for movies. Considering how high of a ratio of movies do I watch in the cinema, it should be really high. But lets check anyway.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn [13]:\n\n\nmovies_year_data = collections.Counter([int(movie['properties']['published'][0]) for movie in movie_data_microformats[\"items\"]])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn [14]:\n\n\npandas.DataFrame(movies_year_data.most_common(), columns=[\"Year\", \"Count\"])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut[14]:\n\n\nYear\nCount\n0\n2023\n17\n1\n2022\n13\n2\n2019\n3\n3\n2021\n1\n4\n2005\n1\n5\n2012\n1\n6\n2016\n1\n7\n2015\n1\n8\n2014\n1\n9\n2020\n1\n10\n1993\n1\n11\n2002\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn [15]:\n\n\npandas.DataFrame([\n    [year, movies_year_data[year]] \n    if year in movies_year_data \n    else [year, 0] \n    for year in list(range(min(movies_year_data.keys()), max(movies_year_data) + 1))\n], columns=[\"Year\", \"Count\"]).plot(kind=\"bar\", x=\"Year\", y=\"Count\", ylabel=\"Count\", xlabel=\"Year\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut[15]:\n\n<Axes: xlabel='Year', ylabel='Count'>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd as I expected, I had not watched a single movie produced before my birth and the majority of movies that I watched were produced in the last two years. I have a very strong recency bias, when it comes to movies - but then I expected that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguages the Movies I Watched were in¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI use media for language learning, so I keep track of the languages, that the movies were originally in and in which did I watched me. While movies are usually not the media I normally choose for this, I guess keeping track of that had become a habit.\nFor cinema movies, I generally take the language from their site. For the non-cinema movies, I take the language data from the IMDB. Not that the later is very... representative of what I want to track. For example, for the Italian movie Rapito (Kidnapped) had Italian as the main language. So the cinema page lists Italian as the language. The IMDB site of the same movie lists the Italian, Hebrew, and Latin - which were all the languages used in the movie.\nIn same cases, I would include multiple languages for the movie, since multiple have substantial role and it would not be the same movie, if everything was in the same language. One that example is Čuvari formule (Guardians of the Formula). It is a very subjective line to draw.\nBut I guess it is easier to just list all of them. And I guess I would need to be more careful of this in the future and not just copy them blindly?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn [16]:\n\n\nmovies_lang = collections.Counter(\n    sum([\n        movie['properties'][\"dub\"][0].split(\", \") \n        if \"dub\" in movie['properties']\n        else movie['properties']['language'][0].split(\", \") \n        for movie in movie_data_microformats[\"items\"]\n    ], [])\n)\nlen(movies_lang)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut[16]:\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn [17]:\n\n\npandas.DataFrame(movies_lang.most_common(), columns=[\"Language\", \"Number of Movies\"])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut[17]:\n\n\nLanguage\nNumber of Movies\n0\nEnglish\n24\n1\nFrench\n7\n2\nJapanese\n6\n3\nGerman\n3\n4\nDanish\n2\n5\nSlovenian\n2\n6\nDzongkha\n2\n7\nItalian\n2\n8\nSerbian\n1\n9\nFinish\n1\n10\nCroatian\n1\n11\nRomanian\n1\n12\nHungarian\n1\n13\nCatalan\n1\n14\nSpanish\n1\n15\nKorean\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn [18]:\n\n\npandas.DataFrame(\n    movies_lang.most_common(), columns=[\"Language\", \"Number of Movies\"]\n).sort_values(by=\"Number of Movies\").plot(kind=\"barh\", x=\"Language\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut[18]:\n\n<Axes: ylabel='Language'>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver half of the movies that I watched were in English. But I also watched movies in the 16 different language - it is just that most languages had a very small amount of movies, they were present in. I was sort of hoping, that English would be less representative. But I guess the English speaking world still holds predominance in the movie world.\nI am surprised that French was that high. But the movies that I watched in French were normally a good ones. So I guess it makes sense.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn [19]:\n\n\ncollections.Counter([\n    (movie['properties']['language'][0], movie['properties'][\"dub\"][0]) \n    for movie in movie_data_microformats[\"items\"] \n    if \"dub\" in movie['properties']\n])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut[19]:\n\nCounter({('English', 'Slovenian'): 1})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was just one movie, that I watched dubbed. And even that one was a mistake. I misread the cinema listing and I though it was going to be in the Ukrainian - since it was an Ukrainian animation movie. On the end I watched it in Slovenian, and found out that the original was in English. Not sure why, but I guess it was the whole war thing going on? Hard to film there and hard to find the voice actors with the language skills elsewhere?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountries the Movies were Associated with¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am actually not sure, how they decide which country the movie is from. The short research seems to indicate, that it is the places, where productions houses have their headquarters? And it might have something to do with financing? Not sure about the last part. If it is in this direction, it is a bit of a stupid metric?\nStill, I was interested in the predominance of the English speaking films in the previous section. So I wanted to see also the countries, from where these movies were from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing the Country Data¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to to this, I first want to make a couple of correction to the maps data. For example, the Asian map looks weird without the Russian and the European looks weird with it. Even though I do count Russian as part of Europe, I am visualising it as part of Asia for the aesthetics purposes.\nAlso, I needed to remove a couple of islands from some countries for the purpose of aesthetics.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn [36]:\n\n\ncountries = geopandas.read_file(geopandas.datasets.get_path(\"naturalearth_lowres\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/tmp/ipykernel_26224/1046189302.py:1: FutureWarning: The geopandas.dataset module is deprecated and will be removed in GeoPandas 1.0.

But from a lot of parts of the world, they are only bringing the movies with romance or living situation (what is book world would be described as literary book). Something, that I usually avoid.\nThough I did enjoy the two Bhutan movies I watched, even though they could be described as the living situation ones. But I would consider both of the comedy. Especially The Monk and the Gun. But honestly, bring us some more shooters like the 범죄도시2 or Sisu. Or comedies like 血いともだち. Or mysteries like Anatomie d’une chute. Or animations and so on.\nSometimes I have the feeling like there is some sort of bias. That people either watch the popular US movies or they watch the literal movies from the rest of the world.

And why is Lola not on the list, even though the director of the movie described it as comedy? (I would put it there as well). Or something like The Monk and the Gun, which is just one big situational comedy?\nI know that I though Oppenheimer is a comedy. And that most people don't agree with me. But still I think they could include more movies there.\nThere are many other comments that I could make, but lets leave it at that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuration of Movies¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn [33]:\n\n\nsorted([[int(movie['Runtime'].replace(\" min\", \"\")), movie[\"Title\"]] for movie in movies_imdb])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut[33]:\n\n[[12, 'Ace Date'],\n [31, 'Strange Way of Life'],\n [79, 'Lola'],\n [80, 'Chii Tomodachi'],\n [83, 'Reality'],\n [91, 'Sisu'],\n [97, 'Sword Art Online: Progressive - Aria of a Starless Night'],\n [99, 'Mavka: The Forest Song'],\n [99, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel'],\n [101, 'Groundhog Day'],\n [102, 'Living'],\n [103, 'A Haunting in Venice'],\n [105, 'The Marvels'],\n [106, 'Suffragette'],\n [107, 'Asterix & Obelix: Mission Cleopatra'],\n [107, 'The Monk and the Gun'],\n [109, 'Sepet Metulja'],\n [110, 'Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom'],\n [112, 'Gekijouban Isekai Quartet: Another World'],\n [112, 'Weathering with You'],\n [114, 'Barbie'],\n [114, 'Death of the Little Match Girl'],\n [114, 'The Banshees of Inisherin'],\n [117, 'Nostalgia'],\n [120, 'Alcarràs'],\n [120, 'Guardians of the Formula'],\n [122, 'Portrait of a Lady on Fire'],\n [123, 'Enola Holmes'],\n [125, 'A Quiet Passion'],\n [125, 'R.M.N.'],\n [126, 'Monster'],\n [127, 'The Promised Land'],\n [129, 'Enola Holmes 2'],\n [129, 'Pride & Prejudice'],\n [131, 'Kubi'],\n [134, 'Gran Turismo'],\n [134, 'Kidnapped'],\n [137, 'A Royal Affair'],\n [139, 'Decision to Leave'],\n [151, 'Anatomy of a Fall'],\n [158, 'Napoleon'],\n [180, 'Oppenheimer']]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn [34]:\n\n\ndurations = collections.Counter([math.floor(int(movie['Runtime'].replace(\" min\", \"\")) / 10) * 10 for movie in movies_imdb])\nmin_duration, max_duration = min(durations), max(durations)\npandas.DataFrame(\n    [[i, durations[i]] for i in range(min_duration, max_duration + 1, 10)], columns=[\"Duration\", \"Count\"]\n).plot(kind=\"bar\", x=\"Duration\", y=\"Count\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut[34]:\n\n<Axes: xlabel='Duration'>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the last part I can analyse the duration of the movies. One cinema in my city have different ticket prices depending on the length of the movie. In their case the cutoff is the 120 minutes. The rest of them have different ticket prices for different movies, but I have not yet figured out the system of their price ticket.\nAnd it seems that the peak of the movies that I watch is just after the cutoff. Though the next ones are just below it. I wonder, if they correspond because of the bias my movie watching? Or are most movies around that time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI do have the data for more than just the movies that I watched, so why don't I check this?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn [35]:\n\n\nall_movies_duration = collections.Counter([\n    math.floor(int(movie['Runtime'].replace(\" min\", \"\").replace(\"S\", \"\")) / 10) * 10 \n    for _, movie in movies_metadata.items() \n    if movie['Runtime'] != \"N/A\"\n])\nmin_all_duration, max_all_duration = min(all_movies_duration), max(all_movies_duration)\npandas.DataFrame(\n    [[i, all_movies_duration[i]] for i in range(min_all_duration, max_all_duration + 1, 10)], columns=[\"Duration\", \"Count\"]\n).plot(kind=\"bar\", x=\"Duration\", y=\"Count\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut[35]:\n\n<Axes: xlabel='Duration'>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it seems that the pick is below two hours. So I guess I am just biased to movies just on the cutoff."

        "html": "<h3>Motivation for the Project</h3>\n<p>Recently <a href=\"https://www.benji.dog/\">Benji</a> had brought up the idea of the movie aggregator. We had conversation about it on a couple of Homebrew website clubs, there was a session <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/2023/SD/movieviewings\">about it on San Diego IndieWeb Camp</a> and we had a conversation about it through our site (starting with <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/2023/12/the-chicken-egg-problem-of-movie-microformats/\">this</a> and currently, probably finished, <a href=\"https://www.benji.dog/notes/1702277465/\">here</a>). </p>\n<p>If I understood his idea, his idea was more a feed of movies that people were watching. And the review aggregator. Now, I do post the <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/movies-and-series/\">list of movies I watched</a>, but I don't do separate posts and I don't do reviews or rating. After this project, I could be convinced otherwise on the reviews, but still don't want to put the numerical rating on it. </p>\n<p>But I found the idea of finding the common interest interesting. Could this be used to see, if some people are watching common movies? What I would be even more interested is to see, if there are some common books we are reading. </p>\n<p>But unlike with books, where I do read books outside of Goodreads, Open Library or Google Books, and even with the ISBN numbers, there does not seems to be a good way to connect different editions and different translations and so on. Open Library is having this data for the books in their database. It seems that this problem would require some more work.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I have yet to watch the movie, that was not in the <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/\">IMDB (Internet Movie Database)</a>. So as long as I could sort of map it to there, I would have a way to connect movies for different members.</p>\n<h3>The First Proof of Concept</h3>\n<p>So I have created the <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/projects/indieweb-movies/\">first proof of concept</a> to see, if anybody is even interested in this. </p>\n<p>It had the three parts to it. </p>\n<p>The first part is the <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/projects/indieweb-movies/network.html\">network representation of the common movies</a>. It does require JavaScript, so for the people that have it blocked, here is the current picture.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"common movies between 5 indieweb members\" src=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/content/images/2023/movies-network.png\" /></p>\n<p>It simply shows either just the common movies or all the movies, and it is possible to filter by IMDB genre. Something that looks pretty. It was also the idea I started with, which is why it stayed the part of it.</p>\n<p>The second one is some <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/projects/indieweb-movies/stats.html\">general statistics</a>. It starts with the leader board of the common movies. I was a bit surprised, that it was Enola Holmes who was the most watched movie. Not the best movie I watched this year, but also not the worst movie I watched this year.</p>\n<p>After that, there are some general statistics of the movie based on the IMDB metadata. I found two things interesting: the year distribution of the movies (the oldest movie watched was from 1900) and the country distribution (we hit all the continents sans Antarctica). </p>\n<p>Though it also made me realise all the problems I have with the IMDB metadata.</p>\n<p>The third one is the <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/projects/indieweb-movies/posters.html\">posters page</a>. It just lists the posters of the watched movies, with the list of people that watched it underneath. </p>\n<p>It also allows filtering by the IMDB metadata. Currently one can only filter by one thing at the time. Just some playing.</p>\n<p>If you want to see the representation of my problem with the IMDB metadata, then just try to filter the movies by country Japan. It includes a lot of movies, that I would not put there, as I would not consider them Japanese movies. But it is easily accessible, so it is there.</p>\n<h3>Technical Background</h3>\n<p>It is a statically generated site. In the background it is this <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/projects/indieweb-movies/Movies%20Analysis.ipynb\">jupyter notebook</a>. I have used <a href=\"https://omdbapi.com/\">OMDb API</a> in the background to get movies metadata and to try to recognise the movies in the posts, that do not have the IMDB URLs in their watched movies list. </p>\n<p>To update the data, I need to run this code locally. So in updates on the sporadic timetable. </p>\n<h3>Thanks to the Early Participants</h3>\n<p>I would here like to thank <a href=\"https://www.benji.dog/\">Benji</a>, <a href=\"https://www.jeremycherfas.net/\">Jeremy</a>, <a href=\"https://marksuth.dev/\">Mark</a> and <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com\">Tracy</a> to give me permission to scrape their data and use it in this project. </p>\n<h3>Volunteer for Participation</h3>\n<p>If you want to have your data included in this project, please <a href=\"mailto:sarajaksa@sarajaksa.eu\">contact me</a>. I prefer to not use the data from somebody else without their permission. Lets us try to be more ethical then the current tech industry. :)</p>\n<p>Also, at least two people pointed me to the better source of movies on their site. Without it, I would have listed a smaller amount of movies for them.</p>\n<h3>Future Ideas</h3>\n<p>Surprisingly, it was the poster page, that had so far provided the most utility to me. It reminded me of the movies that I wanted to watch, but did not yet. And I could check, if they have the DVDs for them in the library. </p>\n<p>In the last year <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/2022/Pop-ups/Personal_Libraries\">pop up about libraries on the websites</a>, there was the idea of the book club. If we could find the common books that multiple people wanted to read, we could have an IndieWeb-like book club. Or something in this direction? And if I could parse the want-to-read book in the same way, it would be possible to see is there are any common books.

I am in one of the group, that does online groups movie watching, so if somebody would be interested in that, this could also be possible?

They're a way that personal websites can interact with each other — you can notify another site when you link to them, and receive notifications when someone links to you. I find them to allow for some of the nicer parts of social interaction on the web, but with much more agency and much less inflammatory or harmful material than something like Facebook or Instagram. However, then can also be a bit intimidating, especially for <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2025/01/09/sanding-off-friction-from-indie-web-connection/\">non-developers</a>.</p>\n\n<p>My goal with this tutorial is that people with a wide range of experience with coding/working in a command line — including no experience — can benefit from it. In particular, if you just read the first two sections, you'll be able to use webmentions by signing up for two services (GitHub and Webmention.io) and adding two lines of HTML to your site:</p>\n<pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>link</span> <span>rel</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>me<span>\"</span></span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>https://github.com/reillypascal<span>\"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>\n<span><span><span>&lt;</span>link</span> <span>rel</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>webmention<span>\"</span></span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>https://webmention.io/reillyspitzfaden.com/webmention<span>\"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>This even works with tools like Squarespace or Wordpress! Beyond that, each section builds on the last, so depending on how much you're comfortable with and/or interested in, you can choose your own adventure. For people with coding experience, I have some fun discussion of parsing and displaying webmentions as comments on your site; automating the process of bringing them into your site without client-side JavaScript; and using tools like <a href=\"https://brid.gy/\">Bridgy</a> to get Fediverse interactions as mentions.</p>\n<p>Here are the tools we'll be using:</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://webmention.io/\">Webmention.io</a> — this is the only strictly necessary one. It's a service by <a href=\"https://aaronparecki.com/\">Aaron Parecki</a> to receive and transmit webmentions so you don't have to run your own server.\n<ul><li>The easiest way to log in to Webmention.io does require a trusted third party account such as <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a>. You don't actually have to <em>do</em> anything with your GitHub account though — as long as it exists and you can log in, you're good.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/\">Eleventy</a> — the static site generator I use to build my site, although you can do the basics of this on any site setup.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a> — the hosting service I use. I use their <a href=\"https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-hooks/\">build hooks</a> to instruct my site to rebuild nightly and pull in new mentions.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://brid.gy/\">Bridgy</a> — if you share a post from your site on Mastodon/Bluesky/etc., this service can turn interactions with that post into webmentions that go to your site. You can then display these as comments on your blog.</li>\n</ul><p>If you have any trouble, the folks on the <a href=\"https://chat.indieweb.org/\">IndieWeb Chat</a> are extremely helpful — you can ask them questions at the link, and the link also includes Discord/Slack versions of the chatroom if that's more your style.</p>\n<p>Let's get started!</p>\n<h3>The Basics with Webmention.io</h3>\n<p>As I mentioned in my <a href=\"https://reillyspitzfaden.com/posts/2024/05/receiving-webmentions-part-1/\">first post</a> on the topic, to start, go to <a href=\"http://webmention.io/\">Webmention.io</a> and sign in using your site URL. You'll need a tag in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of your site that looks something like this: <code>&lt;link rel=\"me\" href=\"https://github.com/reillypascal\" /&gt;</code>. Substitute the URL in the <code>href=\"\"</code> field with your own GitHub profile URL. This allows you to use your website to sign in to Webmention.io, with your GitHub page acting as a trusted third party to verify your identity.</p>\n<p>Once you're logged in, you can go to the “sites” tab of your dashboard (<a href=\"https://webmention.io/settings/sites\">https://webmention.io/settings/sites</a>) and enter your site in the “Create a new Site” field. This tripped me up the first time through, but Aaron <a href=\"https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io/issues/182\">mentioned</a> he didn't want Webmention.io to automatically accept mentions for people who hadn't asked for them, so you have to manually add the site after signing in.</p>\n<p>Once you've added it, you can click “Get Setup Code” next to your site (should be available on your “<a href=\"https://webmention.io/settings/sites\">sites</a>” tab after adding the URL). This will generate a tag you can copy and paste into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element of your page — something like <code>&lt;link rel=\"webmention\" href=\"https://webmention.io/reillyspitzfaden.com/webmention\" /&gt;</code>. You can also just copy my example here, replacing “<a href=\"http://reillyspitzfaden.com\">reillyspitzfaden.com</a>” with your own URL. You're now ready to go!</p>\n<p>If you want to stop here, you can simply link to the endpoint for your site — should look like <a href=\"https://webmention.io/reillyspitzfaden.com/webmention\">https://webmention.io/reillyspitzfaden.com/webmention</a>, or in other words, the URL you put in the <code>href=\"\"</code> field above. People can send you webmentions by putting their post link in the “Source URL” field and your post link in the “Target URL” one. You can view your mentions by going to the dashboard on Webmention.io — <a href=\"https://webmention.io/dashboard\">https://webmention.io/dashboard</a> — while signed in.</p>\n<p>If you want to validate that your mentions are working properly, you can use <a href=\"https://webmention.rocks/\">webmention.rocks</a>, which has a list of tests you can run, with helpful feedback.</p>\n<p>In summary: two lines of HTML in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag, plus a link to your endpoint on each post is plenty to get up and running!</p>\n<h3>Sending Webmentions (No Command Line)</h3>\n<p>There are a number of ways to send webmentions to someone whose post you link to. In many cases, people will include a form at the bottom of posts (e.g., see the bottom of this post), but if you can't find that, you have a few options.</p>\n<p>The simplest way to find someone's endpoint if it's not clearly listed:</p>\n<ul><li>Right-click on the page and choose “View Page Source”</li>\n<li>Cmd + F (Mac) or ctrl + F (Win/Linux) for “webmention”</li>\n<li>If you get a result, it should look something like <code>&lt;link rel=\"webmention\" href=\"https://webmention.io/reillyspitzfaden.com/webmention\" /&gt;</code> from above.</li>\n<li>If you go to the URL in the <code>href=\"\"</code> field, that should be the person's endpoint. You should be able to put your URL in the first field and the target post in the second and mention them!</li>\n</ul><p>A quick way to check if the page supports webmentions before bothering with this is Brent Lineberry's <a href=\"https://orangegnome.com/posts/2929/supports-webmentions-bookmarklet\">Supports Webmentions?</a> bookmarklet. If you bookmark this in your browser, you can click the bookmark while on a page and it will let you know if the page supports webmentions. Juha-Matti Santala also has a <a href=\"https://hamatti.org/posts/webmention-bookmarklet/\">bookmarklet</a> that does something similar. If you right-click in your bookmark bar and paste the code snippet from the bottom of the post into the URL field, it should work. The benefit to this is that clicking on it copies the endpoint URL to your clipboard, so you can ctrl + V/cmd + V it easily.</p>\n<h3>Making a Webmentions Form</h3>\n<p>If you want to make things easier for your visitors, here's how to add a form to your site for people to send you mentions. Below is the HTML I use. Notice the URL in the <code>action=\"\"</code> field — that's the only thing you should have to change to make this work on your site. Replace “<a href=\"http://reillyspitzfaden.com\">reillyspitzfaden.com</a>” with your own URL and you should be set!</p>\n<pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>form</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>webmention-form<span>\"</span></span> <span>action</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>https://webmention.io/reillyspitzfaden.com/webmention<span>\"</span></span> <span>method</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>POST<span>\"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>\n    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>label</span> <span>for</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>webmention-form<span>\"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>&lt;!-- insert any description for the form here --&gt;</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>label</span><span>&gt;</span></span>\n\n    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>input</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>webmention-source<span>\"</span></span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>url<span>\"</span></span> <span>autocomplete</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>url<span>\"</span></span> <span>required</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span><span>\"</span></span> <span>pattern</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>^https?:\\/\\/(.*)<span>\"</span></span> <span>name</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>source<span>\"</span></span> <span>placeholder</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>URL/Permalink of your article<span>\"</span></span> <span>class</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>error<span>\"</span></span> <span>aria-invalid</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>true<span>\"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>\n    \n    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>input</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>webmention-submit<span>\"</span></span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>submit<span>\"</span></span> <span>name</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>submit<span>\"</span></span> <span>value</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>Ping me!<span>\"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>\n\n    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>input</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>webmention-format<span>\"</span></span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>hidden<span>\"</span></span> <span>name</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>format<span>\"</span></span> <span>value</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>html<span>\"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>\n    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>input</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>webmention-target<span>\"</span></span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>hidden<span>\"</span></span> <span>name</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>target<span>\"</span></span> <span>value</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span><span>\"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>\n<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>form</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>One thing to note is that without some further JavaScript, the page will reload and you'll get a white page showing something like this:</p>\n<pre><code><span>{</span>\n  <span>\"status\"</span><span>:</span> <span>\"pending\"</span><span>,</span>\n  <span>\"source\"</span><span>:</span> <span>\"&lt;source-url&gt;\"</span><span>,</span>\n  <span>\"target\"</span><span>:</span> <span>\"&lt;target-url&gt;\"</span><span>,</span>\n  <span>\"private\"</span><span>:</span> <span>false</span><span>,</span>\n  <span>\"summary\"</span><span>:</span> <span>\"The webmention is currently being processed\"</span><span>,</span>\n  <span>\"data\"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>\n  <span>}</span>\n<span>}</span></code></pre>\n<p>I don't mind enough to bother changing this behavior, plus I prefer to minimize client-side JavaScript — which would be necessary — but just something to be aware of.</p>\n<h3>Making Your Mentions Richer with Microformats</h3>\n<p>If you go to the URL <code>https://webmention.io/api/mentions.jf2?token=&lt;your-webmention-token&gt;</code> (get your token <a href=\"https://webmention.io/settings\">here</a> after signing in to Webmention.io), you can view the raw JSON data for webmentions sent to your site, which can be useful for understanding what's going on under the hood. When I first viewed this, I noticed that some people's mentions included details in an “author” field. When I tested sending mentions to myself, my “author” field was blank, and the difference seemed to be <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Microformats\">microformats</a> — after adding them, my “author” field was filled out, as shown below:</p>\n<pre><code><span>\"author\"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>\n    <span>\"type\"</span><span>:</span> <span>\"card\"</span><span>,</span>\n    <span>\"name\"</span><span>:</span> <span>\"Reilly Spitzfaden\"</span><span>,</span>\n    <span>\"photo\"</span><span>:</span> <span>\"https://avatars.webmention.io/reillyspitzfaden.com/10ca64df4721d256914c260109486f3051ac27b5586304a64c6c90d776cd6146.jpg\"</span><span>,</span>\n    <span>\"url\"</span><span>:</span> <span>\"https://reillyspitzfaden.com/\"</span>\n<span>}</span></code></pre>\n<p>Microformats allow embedding properties in a page, to be read by social software, aggregators, search engines, and the like. Microformat tags are added as HTML class names. According to the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Microformats\">MDN Web Docs</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul><li>To create a microformats object, <code>h-*</code> class names are used in the class attribute.</li>\n</ul></blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul><li>To add a property to an object, the <code>p-*</code>, <code>u-*</code>, <code>dt-*</code>, <code>e-*</code> class names are used on one of the object's descendants.</li>\n</ul></blockquote>\n<p>Below is the <a href=\"https://microformats.org/wiki/h-card\"><code>h-card</code></a> markup I use above each of my posts. MDN gives further information about the different prefixes you'll see in my markup <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Microformats#microformats_prefixes\">here</a>.</p>\n<pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>hidden</span><span>&gt;</span></span>\n    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>class</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>p-author h-card<span>\"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>\n        <span><span><span>&lt;</span>a</span> <span>rel</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>author<span>\"</span></span> <span>class</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>u-url u-uid<span>\"</span></span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>https://reillyspitzfaden.com<span>\"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>a</span><span>&gt;</span></span>\n        <span><span><span>&lt;</span>img</span> <span>class</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>u-photo<span>\"</span></span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>https://reillyspitzfaden.com/media/headshot_gbc_kirby_300px.jpg<span>\"</span></span> <span>alt</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>Reilly Spitzfaden<span>\"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>\n        <span><span><span>&lt;</span>span</span> <span>class</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>p-name<span>\"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>\n            <span><span><span>&lt;</span>span</span> <span>class</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>p-given-name<span>\"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>Reilly<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>span</span><span>&gt;</span></span>\n            <span><span><span>&lt;</span>span</span> <span>class</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>p-family-name<span>\"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>Spitzfaden<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>span</span><span>&gt;</span></span>\n        <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>span</span><span>&gt;</span></span>\n        <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>\n    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>a</span> <span>rel</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>syndication<span>\"</span></span> <span>class</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>u-syndication<span>\"</span></span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>\"</span>&lt;mastodon-or-bsky-url&gt;<span>\"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>a</span><span>&gt;</span></span>\n<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>The outer <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> ensures the markup is not diplayed to users. The inner <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> creates a microformats object with the <code>h-card</code> class; the <code>p-author</code> property adds that this card is for an author. The <code>u-url</code> and <code>u-uid</code> classes indicate that “<a href=\"https://reillyspitzfaden.com\">https://reillyspitzfaden.com</a>” is my site URL, with the <code>u-*</code> prefix indicating a link; similarly, <code>u-photo</code> gives a link to a photo to act as an avatar, and <code>u-syndication</code> gives link(s) to where I <a href=\"https://www.citationneeded.news/posse/\">POSSE</a> my posts. The <code>p-name</code>, <code>p-given-name</code>, and <code>p-family-name</code> classes give plain-text information about me (plain-text indicated by the <code>p-*</code> prefix).</p>\n<p>In addition to this card, the entire article (including the card) is surrounded in an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag with the class <code>h-entry</code>, creating a microformat object for the entire entry. The <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> for the post title within that <code>&lt;article</code> has the class <code>p-name</code>, and the content of the post is in a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with the class <code>e-content</code>. As described in the MDN link above, the <code>e-*</code> prefix is for “element tree properties where the entire contained element hierarchy is the value” — i.e., because <code>e-content</code> refers to the entire post contents, rather than any one single HTML element, we use <code>e-*</code>.</p>\n<p>In addition to enriching webmention data, microformats make a number of other <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/\">IndieWeb</a> practices possible, which I will describe more in a future post.</p>\n<h3>Sending Webmentions (Command Line)</h3>\n<p>Searching the page for a mention endpoint and typing into that is not too hard to do, but it's also not very convenient. Two ways to send webmentions using the terminal are to use cURL, or to use <a href=\"https://webmention.app/docs#using-the-command-line\">Webmention.app</a>. With cURL, you format your command as <code>curl -i -d source=source -d target=target endpoint</code>. So for example, to RSVP to the Homebrew Website Club, I might run</p>\n<pre><code><span>curl</span> <span>-i</span> <span>-d</span> <span>source</span><span>=</span><span>\"https://reillyspitzfaden.com/interactions/2025/04/rsvp-homebrew-website-club-americas-april-16/\"</span> <span>-d</span> <span>target</span><span>=</span><span>\"https://events.indieweb.org/2025/04/homebrew-website-club-americas-xCttvgRnN4Pl\"</span> <span>\"https://events.indieweb.org/webmention\"</span></code></pre>\n<p>This again requires knowing the endpoint (either with a bookmarklet or viewing the source). Webmention.app has a command line tool that makes sending mentions particularly easy. Once you've <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download\">installed NodeJS</a>, run <code>npm install @remy/webmention</code> in your terminal in the folder where you want to install this tool. From that folder, you can run</p>\n<pre><code>npx webmention https://reillyspitzfaden.com/feed.xml</code></pre>\n<p>This uses your site's RSS feed to get your most recent posts, so you would substitute your feed URL for mine. This tool will display all links that have webmention endpoints — no manual checking required! You can send webmentions for your latest post by running</p>\n<pre><code>npx webmention https://reillyspitzfaden.com/feed.xml <span>--limit</span> <span>1</span> <span>--send</span></code></pre>\n<p>(again, replacing my feed URL with your own).</p>\n<p>One potential issue is that this package seems to be a little outdated these days. When I tried to install it on my site, NodeJS showed some critical vulnerabilities. When I installed it in its own separate folder, this wasn't as much of an issue for some reason, so you might try that — make a folder, open it in the terminal, and then run <code>npm install @remy/webmention</code>. The <a href=\"https://webmention.app/\">Webmention.app</a> site also offers some other tools, so you might play with those, although I haven't used them myself.</p>\n<h3>Accessing Mentions in Eleventy</h3>\n<p>Eleventy lets you use <a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-js/\">JavaScript data files</a> which will run when the site builds and make the resulting data globally available. These files go in the <code>_data</code> subfolder in your site source directory, and the data is available as an object with the same name as the file (e.g., the file <code>webmentions.mjs</code> will make the data available as the <code>webmentions</code> object globally).</p>\n_data/webmentions.mjs\n<pre><code><span>import</span> EleventyFetch <span>from</span> <span>\"@11ty/eleventy-fetch\"</span><span>;</span>\n\n<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>\n\t<span>const</span> url <span>=</span> <span><span>`</span><span>https://webmention.io/api/mentions.jf2?token=</span><span><span>${</span>process<span>.</span>env<span>.</span><span>WEBMENTION_IO_TOKEN</span><span>}</span></span><span>&amp;per-page=1000</span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>\n\t<span>try</span> <span>{</span>\n\t\t<span>const</span> webmentions <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>EleventyFetch</span><span>(</span>url<span>,</span> <span>{</span>\n\t\t\t<span>duration</span><span>:</span> <span>\"1h\"</span><span>,</span>\n\t\t\t<span>type</span><span>:</span> <span>\"json\"</span><span>,</span>\n\t\t<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>\n\t\t<span>return</span> <span>{</span>\n\t\t\t<span>mentions</span><span>:</span> webmentions<span>.</span>children<span>,</span>\n\t\t<span>}</span><span>;</span>\n\t<span>}</span> <span>catch</span> <span>(</span>e<span>)</span> <span>{</span>\n\t\t<span>return</span> <span>{</span>\n\t\t\t<span>mentions</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span> <span>\"none\"</span> <span>]</span>\n\t\t<span>}</span><span>;</span>\n\t<span>}</span>\n<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre>\n<p>Note that this file is <code>webmentions.mjs</code>, rather than using the <code>.js</code> extension, and it uses <a href=\"https://flaviocopes.com/es-modules/\">ES Modules</a> syntax. As I mentioned <a href=\"https://reillyspitzfaden.com/posts/2025/02/webmentions-without-plugins/\">here</a>, while some tutorials/documentation show CommonJS syntax and the <code>.js</code> extension, I could never get it to work like that. I'm not 100% sure, but it seems to be a difference with Eleventy v3.x.x.</p>\n<p>To get the API <a href=\"https://reillyspitzfaden.com/digital-garden/tutorials/webmention-tutorial/#fn1\">[1]</a> key for Webmention.io, go to <a href=\"https://webmention.io/settings\">https://webmention.io/settings</a> after signing in. In the section “API Key,” there is a value you can copy. As this page mentions,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[if] you don't mind anyone being able to retrieve webmentions to your domain, you don't need to keep this private. The only thing this token can do is retrieve all webmentions to your domain. It can't modify any data on your account.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you don't mind the key being public, you can hard-code it in the URL in <code>_data/webmentions.mjs</code> and skip the next paragraph and the <code>index.js</code> file.</p>\n<p>If you do want to keep it private, you can add the key as an <a href=\"https://docs.netlify.com/environment-variables/get-started/#import-variables-with-the-netlify-ui\">environment variable in Netlify</a>. Note in <code>index.js</code>, I'm importing the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv\"><code>dotenv</code></a> Node package, which allows my site to access these variables.

This lets me show a separate counter of Fediverse/Bluesky interactions on the <a href=\"https://www.citationneeded.news/posse/\">POSSE</a>-ed copies.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>I sort the mentions in reverse chronological order, using the “published” field which you can view in the raw JSON data at <code>https://webmention.io/api/mentions.jf2?token=&lt;your-webmention-token&gt;</code>.</li>\n</ul><p>I then use the Liquid keyword <code>assign</code> to assign the results of the <code>webWebmentions</code> filter to the <code>web_mentions</code> variable, allowing me to access and further parse them in the Liquid template.</p>\n<h3>Automatically Bringing in New Mentions</h3>\n\n<p>Because the <code>_data/webmentions.mjs</code> script brings in new mentions when the site builds, rebuilding the site is a good way to bring in mentions without client-side JavaScript. My site is hosted on <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a>, and a simple way to make the site automatically rebuild is to use <a href=\"https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-hooks/\">build hooks</a>. This is a URL and when you send an HTTP POST request to it, the site will build. You can do this with cURL: <code>curl -X POST -d {} \"https://api.netlify.com/build_hooks/&lt;your-hook-here&gt;\"</code>.</p>\n<p>I send out these POST requests from my home server. The server is a 2015 ASUS laptop running Ubuntu Server, which I set up according to <a href=\"https://chriskalos.notion.site/The-0-Home-Server-Written-Guide-5d5ff30f9bdd4dfbb9ce68f0d914f1f6\">this guide</a>. <a href=\"https://reillyspitzfaden.com/digital-garden/tutorials/webmention-tutorial/#fn2\">[2]</a> GitHub actions are also another good way of scheduling this — Benji links to how he does that <a href=\"https://www.benji.dog/notes/1738091887/\">here</a>. I actually tried doing it with GitHub actions first, but for some reason, I couldn't get scheduled actions with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron\"><code>cron</code></a>. to work for me.</p>\n<p>On my home server, however, <code>cron</code> was super easy to use. <code>cron</code> syntax has 5 fields: minute, hour, day (month), month, day (week). You can give them a value, or use an asterisk (“*”) to allow all values. <code>0 2 * * *</code> in the example below means “run every day at 2:00 GMT, regardless of month or day.” This <a href=\"https://crontab.guru/\">crontab.guru</a> tool may be helpful in figuring out the syntax. Note that the times are in GMT, rather than the local time zone, so you would need to convert to local time. To set up a <code>cron</code> job, type <code>crontab -e</code> (i.e., “edit the crontab file”) into your server's terminal, and add a line like the following to the file that opens:</p>\n<pre><code><span>0</span> <span>2</span> * * * <span>curl</span> <span>-X</span> POST <span>-d</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span> <span>\"https://api.netlify.com/build_hooks/&lt;your-hook-here&gt;\"</span></code></pre>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading!

        "text": "Please feel free to use the table of contents to skip around — individual sections can be read on their own as mini-tutorials on a topic!\nWebmentions are great! They're a way that personal websites can interact with each other — you can notify another site when you link to them, and receive notifications when someone links to you. I find them to allow for some of the nicer parts of social interaction on the web, but with much more agency and much less inflammatory or harmful material than something like Facebook or Instagram. However, then can also be a bit intimidating, especially for non-developers.\n\nMy goal with this tutorial is that people with a wide range of experience with coding/working in a command line — including no experience — can benefit from it. In particular, if you just read the first two sections, you'll be able to use webmentions by signing up for two services (GitHub and Webmention.io) and adding two lines of HTML to your site:\n<link rel=\"me\" href=\"https://github.com/reillypascal\" />\n<link rel=\"webmention\" href=\"https://webmention.io/reillyspitzfaden.com/webmention\" />\nThis even works with tools like Squarespace or Wordpress! Beyond that, each section builds on the last, so depending on how much you're comfortable with and/or interested in, you can choose your own adventure. For people with coding experience, I have some fun discussion of parsing and displaying webmentions as comments on your site; automating the process of bringing them into your site without client-side JavaScript; and using tools like Bridgy to get Fediverse interactions as mentions.\nHere are the tools we'll be using:\nWebmention.io — this is the only strictly necessary one. It's a service by Aaron Parecki to receive and transmit webmentions so you don't have to run your own server.\nThe easiest way to log in to Webmention.io does require a trusted third party account such as GitHub. You don't actually have to do anything with your GitHub account though — as long as it exists and you can log in, you're good.\n\nEleventy — the static site generator I use to build my site, although you can do the basics of this on any site setup.\nNetlify — the hosting service I use. I use their build hooks to instruct my site to rebuild nightly and pull in new mentions.\nBridgy — if you share a post from your site on Mastodon/Bluesky/etc., this service can turn interactions with that post into webmentions that go to your site. You can then display these as comments on your blog.\nIf you have any trouble, the folks on the IndieWeb Chat are extremely helpful — you can ask them questions at the link, and the link also includes Discord/Slack versions of the chatroom if that's more your style.\nLet's get started!\nThe Basics with Webmention.io\nAs I mentioned in my first post on the topic, to start, go to Webmention.io and sign in using your site URL. You'll need a tag in the <head> of your site that looks something like this: <link rel=\"me\" href=\"https://github.com/reillypascal\" />. Substitute the URL in the href=\"\" field with your own GitHub profile URL. This allows you to use your website to sign in to Webmention.io, with your GitHub page acting as a trusted third party to verify your identity.\nOnce you're logged in, you can go to the “sites” tab of your dashboard (https://webmention.io/settings/sites) and enter your site in the “Create a new Site” field. This tripped me up the first time through, but Aaron mentioned he didn't want Webmention.io to automatically accept mentions for people who hadn't asked for them, so you have to manually add the site after signing in.\nOnce you've added it, you can click “Get Setup Code” next to your site (should be available on your “sites” tab after adding the URL). This will generate a tag you can copy and paste into the <head> element of your page — something like <link rel=\"webmention\" href=\"https://webmention.io/reillyspitzfaden.com/webmention\" />. You can also just copy my example here, replacing “reillyspitzfaden.com” with your own URL. You're now ready to go!\nIf you want to stop here, you can simply link to the endpoint for your site — should look like https://webmention.io/reillyspitzfaden.com/webmention, or in other words, the URL you put in the href=\"\" field above. People can send you webmentions by putting their post link in the “Source URL” field and your post link in the “Target URL” one. You can view your mentions by going to the dashboard on Webmention.io — https://webmention.io/dashboard — while signed in.\nIf you want to validate that your mentions are working properly, you can use webmention.rocks, which has a list of tests you can run, with helpful feedback.\nIn summary: two lines of HTML in the <head> tag, plus a link to your endpoint on each post is plenty to get up and running!\nSending Webmentions (No Command Line)\nThere are a number of ways to send webmentions to someone whose post you link to. In many cases, people will include a form at the bottom of posts (e.g., see the bottom of this post), but if you can't find that, you have a few options.\nThe simplest way to find someone's endpoint if it's not clearly listed:\nRight-click on the page and choose “View Page Source”\nCmd + F (Mac) or ctrl + F (Win/Linux) for “webmention”\nIf you get a result, it should look something like <link rel=\"webmention\" href=\"https://webmention.io/reillyspitzfaden.com/webmention\" /> from above.\nIf you go to the URL in the href=\"\" field, that should be the person's endpoint. You should be able to put your URL in the first field and the target post in the second and mention them!\nA quick way to check if the page supports webmentions before bothering with this is Brent Lineberry's Supports Webmentions? bookmarklet. If you bookmark this in your browser, you can click the bookmark while on a page and it will let you know if the page supports webmentions. Juha-Matti Santala also has a bookmarklet that does something similar. If you right-click in your bookmark bar and paste the code snippet from the bottom of the post into the URL field, it should work. The benefit to this is that clicking on it copies the endpoint URL to your clipboard, so you can ctrl + V/cmd + V it easily.\nMaking a Webmentions Form\nIf you want to make things easier for your visitors, here's how to add a form to your site for people to send you mentions. Below is the HTML I use. Notice the URL in the action=\"\" field — that's the only thing you should have to change to make this work on your site. Replace “reillyspitzfaden.com” with your own URL and you should be set!\n<form id=\"webmention-form\" action=\"https://webmention.io/reillyspitzfaden.com/webmention\" method=\"POST\">\n    <label for=\"webmention-form\"><!-- insert any description for the form here --></label>\n\n    <input id=\"webmention-source\" type=\"url\" autocomplete=\"url\" required=\"\" pattern=\"^https?:\\/\\/(.*)\" name=\"source\" placeholder=\"URL/Permalink of your article\" class=\"error\" aria-invalid=\"true\">\n    \n    <input id=\"webmention-submit\" type=\"submit\" name=\"submit\" value=\"Ping me!\">\n\n    <input id=\"webmention-format\" type=\"hidden\" name=\"format\" value=\"html\">\n    <input id=\"webmention-target\" type=\"hidden\" name=\"target\" value=\"\">\n</form>\nOne thing to note is that without some further JavaScript, the page will reload and you'll get a white page showing something like this:\n{\n  \"status\": \"pending\",\n  \"source\": \"<source-url>\",\n  \"target\": \"<target-url>\",\n  \"private\": false,\n  \"summary\": \"The webmention is currently being processed\",\n  \"data\": {\n  }\n}\nI don't mind enough to bother changing this behavior, plus I prefer to minimize client-side JavaScript — which would be necessary — but just something to be aware of.\nMaking Your Mentions Richer with Microformats\nIf you go to the URL https://webmention.io/api/mentions.jf2?token=<your-webmention-token> (get your token here after signing in to Webmention.io), you can view the raw JSON data for webmentions sent to your site, which can be useful for understanding what's going on under the hood. When I first viewed this, I noticed that some people's mentions included details in an “author” field. When I tested sending mentions to myself, my “author” field was blank, and the difference seemed to be microformats — after adding them, my “author” field was filled out, as shown below:\n\"author\": {\n    \"type\": \"card\",\n    \"name\": \"Reilly Spitzfaden\",\n    \"photo\": \"https://avatars.webmention.io/reillyspitzfaden.com/10ca64df4721d256914c260109486f3051ac27b5586304a64c6c90d776cd6146.jpg\",\n    \"url\": \"https://reillyspitzfaden.com/\"\n}\nMicroformats allow embedding properties in a page, to be read by social software, aggregators, search engines, and the like. Microformat tags are added as HTML class names. According to the MDN Web Docs\n\nTo create a microformats object, h-* class names are used in the class attribute.\n\n\nTo add a property to an object, the p-*, u-*, dt-*, e-* class names are used on one of the object's descendants.\n\nBelow is the h-card markup I use above each of my posts. MDN gives further information about the different prefixes you'll see in my markup here.\n<div hidden>\n    <div class=\"p-author h-card\">\n        <a rel=\"author\" class=\"u-url u-uid\" href=\"https://reillyspitzfaden.com\"></a>\n        <img class=\"u-photo\" src=\"https://reillyspitzfaden.com/media/headshot_gbc_kirby_300px.jpg\" alt=\"Reilly Spitzfaden\">\n        <span class=\"p-name\">\n            <span class=\"p-given-name\">Reilly</span>\n            <span class=\"p-family-name\">Spitzfaden</span>\n        </span>\n        </div>\n    <a rel=\"syndication\" class=\"u-syndication\" href=\"<mastodon-or-bsky-url>\"></a>\n</div>\nThe outer <div> ensures the markup is not diplayed to users. The inner <div> creates a microformats object with the h-card class; the p-author property adds that this card is for an author. The u-url and u-uid classes indicate that “https://reillyspitzfaden.com” is my site URL, with the u-* prefix indicating a link; similarly, u-photo gives a link to a photo to act as an avatar, and u-syndication gives link(s) to where I POSSE my posts. The p-name, p-given-name, and p-family-name classes give plain-text information about me (plain-text indicated by the p-* prefix).\nIn addition to this card, the entire article (including the card) is surrounded in an <article> tag with the class h-entry, creating a microformat object for the entire entry. The <h2> for the post title within that <article has the class p-name, and the content of the post is in a <div> with the class e-content. As described in the MDN link above, the e-* prefix is for “element tree properties where the entire contained element hierarchy is the value” — i.e., because e-content refers to the entire post contents, rather than any one single HTML element, we use e-*.\nIn addition to enriching webmention data, microformats make a number of other IndieWeb practices possible, which I will describe more in a future post.\nSending Webmentions (Command Line)\nSearching the page for a mention endpoint and typing into that is not too hard to do, but it's also not very convenient. Two ways to send webmentions using the terminal are to use cURL, or to use Webmention.app. With cURL, you format your command as curl -i -d source=source -d target=target endpoint. So for example, to RSVP to the Homebrew Website Club, I might run\ncurl -i -d source=\"https://reillyspitzfaden.com/interactions/2025/04/rsvp-homebrew-website-club-americas-april-16/\" -d target=\"https://events.indieweb.org/2025/04/homebrew-website-club-americas-xCttvgRnN4Pl\" \"https://events.indieweb.org/webmention\"\nThis again requires knowing the endpoint (either with a bookmarklet or viewing the source). Webmention.app has a command line tool that makes sending mentions particularly easy. Once you've installed NodeJS, run npm install @remy/webmention in your terminal in the folder where you want to install this tool. From that folder, you can run\nnpx webmention https://reillyspitzfaden.com/feed.xml\nThis uses your site's RSS feed to get your most recent posts, so you would substitute your feed URL for mine. This tool will display all links that have webmention endpoints — no manual checking required! You can send webmentions for your latest post by running\nnpx webmention https://reillyspitzfaden.com/feed.xml --limit 1 --send\n(again, replacing my feed URL with your own).\nOne potential issue is that this package seems to be a little outdated these days. When I tried to install it on my site, NodeJS showed some critical vulnerabilities. When I installed it in its own separate folder, this wasn't as much of an issue for some reason, so you might try that — make a folder, open it in the terminal, and then run npm install @remy/webmention. The Webmention.app site also offers some other tools, so you might play with those, although I haven't used them myself.\nAccessing Mentions in Eleventy\nEleventy lets you use JavaScript data files which will run when the site builds and make the resulting data globally available. These files go in the _data subfolder in your site source directory, and the data is available as an object with the same name as the file (e.g., the file webmentions.mjs will make the data available as the webmentions object globally).\n_data/webmentions.mjs\nimport EleventyFetch from \"@11ty/eleventy-fetch\";\n\nexport default async function () {\n\tconst url = `https://webmention.io/api/mentions.jf2?token=${process.env.WEBMENTION_IO_TOKEN}&per-page=1000`;\n\ttry {\n\t\tconst webmentions = await EleventyFetch(url, {\n\t\t\tduration: \"1h\",\n\t\t\ttype: \"json\",\n\t\t});\n\t\treturn {\n\t\t\tmentions: webmentions.children,\n\t\t};\n\t} catch (e) {\n\t\treturn {\n\t\t\tmentions: [ \"none\" ]\n\t\t};\n\t}\n};\nNote that this file is webmentions.mjs, rather than using the .js extension, and it uses ES Modules syntax. As I mentioned here, while some tutorials/documentation show CommonJS syntax and the .js extension, I could never get it to work like that. I'm not 100% sure, but it seems to be a difference with Eleventy v3.x.x.\nTo get the API [1] key for Webmention.io, go to https://webmention.io/settings after signing in. In the section “API Key,” there is a value you can copy. As this page mentions,\n\n[if] you don't mind anyone being able to retrieve webmentions to your domain, you don't need to keep this private. The only thing this token can do is retrieve all webmentions to your domain. It can't modify any data on your account.\n\nIf you don't mind the key being public, you can hard-code it in the URL in _data/webmentions.mjs and skip the next paragraph and the index.js file.\nIf you do want to keep it private, you can add the key as an environment variable in Netlify. Note in index.js, I'm importing the dotenv Node package, which allows my site to access these variables. If you substitute your key into the line https://webmention.io/api/mentions.jf2?token=${process.env.WEBMENTION_IO_TOKEN}&per-page=1000, you get all webmentions available as an object, with the list of mentions in the children field.\nindex.js\nrequire(\"dotenv\").config();\nBelow is the Liquid template I use to import these mentions. As I mentioned above, if you go to the URL https://webmention.io/api/mentions.jf2?token=<your-webmention-token>, you can view the raw JSON data, in which you'll see the field “wm-property.” Possible values for “wm-property” are in-reply-to, like-of, repost-of, bookmark-of, mention-of, and rsvp, according to the Webmention.io API guide. As shown in my code below, I use this list of properties to display, e.g., “someone liked this post,” or “someone replied to this post,” falling back on the generic “mentioned” for the rest of the properties.\n{% assign pageUrl = \"https://reillyspitzfaden.com\" | append: page.url %}\n{% assign web_mentions = webmentions.mentions | webWebmentions: pageUrl %}\n\n{% for mention in web_mentions reversed %}\n    <div class=\"webmention-comment\">\n        {%- if mention.author.name and mention.author.name != \"\" %}\n            {{ mention.author.name }}\n        {%- else %}\n            Someone\n        {%- endif %}\n\n        <a href=\"{{ mention.url }}\">\n            {%- if mention[\"wm-property\"] == \"like-of\" -%}\n                liked\n            {%- elsif mention[\"wm-property\"] == \"in-reply-to\" -%}\n                replied to\n            {%- else -%}\n                mentioned\n            {%- endif -%}\n        </a> this post\n        {%- if mention.content.text %}\n            <blockquote>{{ mention.content.text | truncate: 175 }}</blockquote>\n        {%- endif %}\n    </div>\n{% endfor %}\nNotice the custom Liquid filter webWebmentions. The vertical pipe character “|” sends the value webmentions.mentions from _data/webmentions.mjs into the filter, with the colon after webWebmentions allowing me to send the additional value of pageUrl to the filter. The code for the filter is in my eleventy.config.js file, and is shown below:\neleventyConfig.addFilter(\"webWebmentions\", function(webmentions, url) {  \n  const pageWebmentions = webmentions\n    .filter((mention) => mention[\"wm-target\"] == url)\n    .filter((mention) => !mention[\"wm-source\"].includes(\"https://brid.gy/\"))\n    .filter((mention) => !mention[\"wm-source\"].includes(\"https://bsky.brid.gy/\"))\n    .sort((a, b) => new Date(b.published) - new Date(a.published))\n  \n  return pageWebmentions;\n});\nI filter the mentions by the following rules:\nThe wm-target property is the URL for the page — i.e., the mention refers to this post\nThe wm-source property does not include “https://brid.gy/” or “https://bsky.brid.gy/” — i.e., the mention is from someone's blog, rather than being a Mastodon/Bluesky interaction bridged over with Ryan Barrett's Bridgy service.\nThe counterpart to this filter, fediWebmentions does the opposite, only allowing mentions that are from those two URLs. This lets me show a separate counter of Fediverse/Bluesky interactions on the POSSE-ed copies.\n\nI sort the mentions in reverse chronological order, using the “published” field which you can view in the raw JSON data at https://webmention.io/api/mentions.jf2?token=<your-webmention-token>.\nI then use the Liquid keyword assign to assign the results of the webWebmentions filter to the web_mentions variable, allowing me to access and further parse them in the Liquid template.\nAutomatically Bringing in New Mentions\n\nBecause the _data/webmentions.mjs script brings in new mentions when the site builds, rebuilding the site is a good way to bring in mentions without client-side JavaScript. My site is hosted on Netlify, and a simple way to make the site automatically rebuild is to use build hooks. This is a URL and when you send an HTTP POST request to it, the site will build. You can do this with cURL: curl -X POST -d {} \"https://api.netlify.com/build_hooks/<your-hook-here>\".\nI send out these POST requests from my home server. The server is a 2015 ASUS laptop running Ubuntu Server, which I set up according to this guide. [2] GitHub actions are also another good way of scheduling this — Benji links to how he does that here. I actually tried doing it with GitHub actions first, but for some reason, I couldn't get scheduled actions with cron. to work for me.\nOn my home server, however, cron was super easy to use. cron syntax has 5 fields: minute, hour, day (month), month, day (week). You can give them a value, or use an asterisk (“*”) to allow all values. 0 2 * * * in the example below means “run every day at 2:00 GMT, regardless of month or day.” This crontab.guru tool may be helpful in figuring out the syntax. Note that the times are in GMT, rather than the local time zone, so you would need to convert to local time. To set up a cron job, type crontab -e (i.e., “edit the crontab file”) into your server's terminal, and add a line like the following to the file that opens:\n0 2 * * * curl -X POST -d {} \"https://api.netlify.com/build_hooks/<your-hook-here>\"\n\nThanks for reading! Hopefully this can be of assistance to someone.\nYou can find more information about the complete Webmention.io API here. ↩︎\n\nI use this server for a ton of things, including a Jellyfin home streaming server — instructions included in the server guide linked above — and a copy of Syncthing so my devices are always synced, even if only some are active at any given time. It's very nice, and I'll definitely discuss more about that later! ↩︎"
