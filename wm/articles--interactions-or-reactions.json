      "html": "<p>The Open Heart Protocol is a simple way to add anonymous reactions to your blog, developed by <a href=\"https://muan.co/\">Mu-An Chiou</a>. (I’ll say simple, <a href=\"https://www.benji.dog/articles/interactions-or-reactions/\">with the help of Benji</a> — my eyes glossed over at the <a href=\"https://openheart.fyi/\">actual protocol page</a>, short though it may be.) I added it to my site this week, so anyone can “heart” a post. Benji set up some other emoji options but I’m going to keep it simple for now and start with only a heart.</p>\n<p>This came out of the conversation the IndieWeb’s been having about <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2024/03/01/indieweb-interactions-what-builds-connection\">casual interactions</a>. The Open Heart Protocol adds an easy option for readers to react to a post without having to comment or send a Webmention*. I like when other people’s websites have similar functionality — sometimes I don’t have a response so it’s nice when there’s another means to show appreciation.</p>\n*(I recognize it’s possible for people to send <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/reacji\">emoji reactions</a> via Webmention, but a) <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2024/04/22/webbing-the-indieweb/\">not everyone has a website</a>, b) not everyone uses Webmentions, c) this is way easier and faster than sending a Webmention, and d) there are social forces that may discourage using Webmentions for very small interactions like this.)<p>On social media, likes and reactions can influence people to post differently, seeking reactions. I doubt that adding this heart feature will make me feel any pressure since I don’t get a notification — I’ll just notice it the next time I go back to that post, which could be the next day or months later. I write often enough and about such a broad range of topics, I’d naturally expect some to be more interesting to other people, and not getting anonymous likes on a post I wrote for myself isn’t going to deter me from writing more things for myself. The indie web is also small enough that I’ve been trained not to expect a ton of feedback on anything I publish here.</p>\n<p>Since leaving a heart is anonymous, there’s no social pressure for any reader to “be seen” liking something. In that sense it’s not a two-way “relationship building” feature, but not everything needs to be. We can be <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2023/11/30/building-community-out-of-strangers/\">friendly strangers</a> — driving, we’ve got the courtesy wave, online, we have reacjis ????</p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<h2>How I added Open Heart Protocol to my theme</h2>\n<h3>What code I added</h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.benji.dog/articles/interactions-or-reactions/\">Benji’s code</a>, there’s a spot that needs to be filled in with the link to the item being hearted. That URL must reflect the actual post, not just the overall domain — my first attempt ran into this problem ???? I didn’t know how to do that in WordPress, but Benji pointed me the right direction: you can call the post’s permalink from inside the theme.</p>\n<p>What I got working to call the permalink was* (key section bolded):<br /><code>&lt;open-heart href=\"https://corazon.sploot.com?id=<strong>&lt;?php echo esc_url( get_permalink( $post_id )); ?&gt;</strong>\" emoji=\"❤️\"&gt;❤️&lt;/open-heart&gt;</code></p>\n*(People who know what they’re doing, please tell me if I’ve done something terribly wrong here ???? I just tried different options I found until it worked!)<p>All together with the stuff that actually makes it run, the code block for the heart looks like this (copied from Benji aside from updating the ID):<br /><code>&lt;open-heart href=\"https://corazon.sploot.com?id=&lt;?php echo esc_url( get_permalink( $post_id )); ?&gt;\" emoji=\"❤️\"&gt;❤️&lt;/open-heart&gt;<br />\n&lt;!-- load webcomponent --&gt;<br />\n&lt;script src=\"https://unpkg.com/open-heart-element\" type=\"module\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />\n&lt;!-- when the webcomponent loads, fetch the current counts for that page --&gt;<br />\n&lt;script&gt;<br />\nwindow.customElements.whenDefined('open-heart').then(() =&gt; {<br />\nfor (const oh of document.querySelectorAll('open-heart')) {<br />\noh.getCount()<br />\n}<br />\n})<br />\n// refresh component after click<br />\nwindow.addEventListener('open-heart', e =&gt; {<br />\ne &amp;&amp; e.target &amp;&amp; e.target.getCount &amp;&amp; e.target.getCount()<br />\n})<br />\n&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>\n<h3>Where I put the code</h3>\n<p>First I had to decide <strong>where I wanted the heart to appear on the post page</strong>. I tried adding the heart to the footer but it looked bad and like it was going to be a pain to style. I ultimately added it to the post header meta information, next to the permalink and link to the comments section. Every theme is different, so you may want to put yours somewhere else. For me, that spot was easy to add to within my theme. (I’m using a personal child theme of the WordPress theme Twenty Twenty.)</p>\n<p>You can edit your theme directly through the web interface by navigating to Appearance &gt; Theme File Editor. The file to modify is <strong>template-tags.php</strong>, which is under the folder “inc.” Make sure your child theme is selected in the upper right dropdown (<em>unless it doesn’t work in your child theme, then do it in the main theme and remember you’ll have to add the code again whenever you update your theme *sad trombone* It didn’t work in my child theme, so I made the change in both places</em> ????‍♀️)</p>\n<p>I snuck it in as an additional list item “after” comments, here (in the Twenty Twenty theme v2.6, this starts on line 453 of the template-tags file):</p>\n<p><code>// Comments link <strong>AND Open Heart Protocol .</strong><br />\nif ( in_array( 'comments', $post_meta, true ) &amp;&amp; ! post_password_required() &amp;&amp; ( comments_open() || get_comments_number() ) ) {<br />\n$has_meta = true;<br />\n?&gt;<br />\n&lt;li class=\"post-comment-link meta-wrapper\"&gt;<br />\n&lt;span class=\"meta-icon\"&gt;<br />\n&lt;?php twentytwenty_the_theme_svg( 'comment' ); ?&gt;<br />\n&lt;/span&gt;<br />\n&lt;span class=\"meta-text\"&gt;<br />\n&lt;?php comments_popup_link(); ?&gt;<br />\n&lt;/span&gt;<br />\n&lt;/li&gt;<br /><strong>&lt;li class=\"post-heart meta-wrapper\"&gt;</strong><strong><br />\n&lt;open-heart href=\"https://corazon.sploot.com?id=&lt;?php echo esc_url( get_permalink( $post_id )); ?&gt;\" emoji=\"❤️\"&gt;❤️&lt;/open-heart&gt;</strong><strong><br />\n&lt;!-- load webcomponent --&gt;</strong><strong><br />\n&lt;script src=\"https://unpkg.com/open-heart-element\" type=\"module\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</strong><strong><br />\n&lt;!-- when the webcomponent loads, fetch the current counts for that page --&gt;</strong><strong><br />\n&lt;script&gt;</strong><strong><br />\nwindow.customElements.whenDefined('open-heart').then(() =&gt; {</strong><strong><br />\nfor (const oh of document.querySelectorAll('open-heart')) {</strong><strong><br />\noh.getCount()</strong><strong><br />\n}</strong><strong><br />\n})</strong><strong><br />\n// refresh component after click</strong><strong><br />\nwindow.addEventListener('open-heart', e =&gt; {</strong><strong><br />\ne &amp;&amp; e.target &amp;&amp; e.target.getCount &amp;&amp; e.target.getCount()</strong><strong><br />\n})</strong><strong><br />\n&lt;/script&gt;</strong><strong><br />\n&lt;/li&gt;</strong></code></p>\n<p>(If you wanted to put the heart in the post footer instead, I believe that would be in the file content.php in the folder “template-parts,” near the bottom post meta.)</p>\n<h2>Styling my heart</h2>\n<p>Benji provided some starter CSS, which I modified slightly to better match my own theme. I took away the border that signals it’s a button, so it may be a somewhat invisible tool… except that social media has trained us on these icons as feedback mechanisms, so if people see it, I think they’ll know what it is. Also, it’s an experiment, so it’s ok if I need to make some changes to make it work better!</p>\n<p>Here’s the styling that I added to my theme using Customize &gt; Additional CSS:</p>\n<p><code>/* open heart protocol */<br />\nopen-heart {<br />\nborder: 0;<br />\nmargin-right:1em;<br />\nopacity:0.75;<br />\n}<br />\nopen-heart:not([disabled]):hover,<br />\nopen-heart:not([disabled]):focus {<br />\nborder: 0;<br />\ncursor: pointer;<br />\nopacity:1;<br />\n}<br />\nopen-heart[disabled] {<br />\ncursor: not-allowed;<br />\n}<br />\nopen-heart[count]:not([count=\"0\"])::after {<br />\ncontent: \" \"attr(count);<br />\n}</code></p>",

Read the introduction on “<a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2024/12/30/mindset-of-more/\">the mindset of more</a>.”</em></p>\n<p>The Internet feels like an old relative’s hoarder house, the hallways so packed with clutter you can barely squeeze through. At one point they remembered where some of the important things were, but not anymore. You already can’t find anything beneath the junk mail, and the mismatched mass of <i>stuff </i>all blends together into one — at this point you’d be thrilled to uncover their collection of chipped Hummel figurines simply for the sake of coherence — and you also can’t stop them from bringing more shit home.</p>\n<p>I find myself<a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2024/04/01/gulping-information/\"> collecting an informational hoard</a>, amassing articles in my read-it-later app and piling books onto my TBR. The more information I’m exposed to, the more I realize how little I know, and the more I feel compelled to patch this deficit. <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2023/11/10/the-pros-and-cons-of-sponginess/\">I hunger for the new</a>; <strong>even when I have plenty of articles saved to Instapaper, my default action is to gather <i>more</i></strong>. Who knows what I might miss if I don’t check what’s new? What if there’s a better article, a better book, a better explanation to be found?</p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p>Curator Hans Ulrich Oberst <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2024/02/23/read-ways-of-curating/\">notes that</a> <b>for most of history, </b><b><i>scarcity</i></b><b> was the challenge; now, </b><b><i>overproduction</i></b><b> is</b>. Today, the pace that new content is flung at us means that, without substantial willpower or intentionality, we’re so busy consuming <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2023/08/15/reserving-mental-space-for-myself/\">we don’t have time to <i>think</i></a>. <strong>Trying to keep up means we rarely take the time to step back and think about what we’re keeping up with.</strong> Dependent on pageviews for advertising revenue, publications pull every trick in the book to steal our attention. <strong>My own curiosities are swamped</strong> by the neverending pile of information dumped on my mental threshold each day.</p>\n<p><em>NB: in this post, I’m mostly talking about non-fiction books and articles online, though I also find my phone gets in the way of reading fiction sometimes too!</em></p>\n<p>Over the past couple years, I’ve <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2023/09/07/articles-i-read-today-september-7-2023/\">tracked everything I read in a day</a> <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2024/05/17/articles-i-read-today-may-16-2024/\">several times</a>. This gave me a better understanding of what I was reading, and <strong>how much I could actually read in a day — it’s less than I expected</strong>. Depending on length, it might be as few as five articles, or if I spend an entire Saturday lounging around reading the internet, as many as twenty articles. Let’s call it an average of fifteen. This knowledge alone has been enough to jolt me out of reading some stuff that was obviously attention bait – <i>is this worth one of my fifteen reading slots for the day?</i> (Reading for entertainment isn’t bad, I just want to do so intentionally.)</p>\n<p><strong>Information acts as a modern enchantment, keeping us in its sway.</strong> When I decide to read, I instinctively pick up my phone instead of a book. And as much as I think <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2024/11/30/the-impact-of-online-writing/\">online writing is valuable and important</a>, some writing is higher quality than others. (I don’t mean quality at the prose level, more <em>impact</em>. Because I also get annoyed by fancified writing that overcomplicates itself — I’ve learned to steer clear of literary reviews ????) I seem to gravitate towards the same kind of Substack personal essay, so if I unthinkingly read whatever has emotional pull, when I emerge from the haze, I realize I’ve read several interchangeable vibes pieces that I couldn’t tell you who wrote.</p>\n<p>I want to escape emotional manipulation and choose what I invest my limited time in more intentionally. If I notice I’m interested in a particular topic, I want to seek out and read higher quality material about it – more books! more complicated books! – when I have the mental energy. In essence, I want to <b>replace my “mental junk food” binge habit with more thoughtful reading</b>.</p>\n<p>As I’ve practiced being more intentional about what I read, I’ve honed in on a few filters for myself:</p>\n<h2>Three “rules” for attention</h2>\n<ol><li>Choose what to read based on <b><i>my </i></b><b>interest, not “to be an informed person”</b></li>\n<li><b>Be skeptical of titles that invoke fear</b>; be wary of articles framed to make me feel superior to others</li>\n<li>Prioritize information that will <b>directly impact my life or community</b>; pay less attention to news outside my control</li>\n</ol><p>I still fall for things that break these rules all the time, but having them has helped me turn down a lot of reading in favor of better options for me.</p>\n<h2>Why we feel the need to consume <i>more</i></h2>\n<p>My friend pointed out that <strong>our appetites developed in an age of scarcity</strong>, when we needed to consume as much as we could find, and more information was always better. We weren’t made to resist information, and our brains reward us for feeding ourselves more, even if those intellectual calories turn out to be hollow. In a world of scarcity, easy calories were a better choice than hard-to-get ones — but the information that’s easiest to come by is often the lowest quality, or worse, manipulative.</p>\n<p>Understanding <strong>the emotional forces that influence what I decide to read</strong> is my first step towards asserting control over what information I spend my time and mental energy on.</p>\n<h3>Information makes us feel in control</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://haleynahman.substack.com/p/172-the-pleasure-of-not-knowing\">Haley Nahman recognizes how our consumption habits assuage our anxiety</a>: “There are infinite resources available to quell our voids.” <strong>Having the theoretical ability to have information makes us feel like we <i>need </i>it.</strong> Yet our anxiety “isn’t caused by a lack of answers to [our] swirl of questions, but the swirl itself.” I have anxiety, and our modern information system seems tailor-made to feed off and amplify my worries.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the reason we keep <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2024/09/11/article-pairing-missing-information/\">gathering information</a> is that <b>we conflate being informed with being in control</b>. With <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2023/05/04/discerning-the-value-of-note-taking/\">enough knowledge</a>, we’ll never lose our jobs, we’ll keep ourselves and our loved ones safe, we’ll know how to survive if the government really starts rounding up leftists.<a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2022/05/13/article-pairing-stop-reading-the-news/\"> Knowing what’s going on in D.C. at every moment</a> becomes a way to feel that we are participating, believe that we understand what’s happening, and assure ourselves that we will be able to react to whatever happens.</p>\n<p><b>Gathering information substitutes knowledge for action.</b> In <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2024/12/28/read-capitalist-realism/\">Capitalist Realism</a>, Mark Fisher describes the concept of interpassivity:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“A film like Wall-E exemplifies what Robert Pfaller has called <b>‘interpassivity’: the film performs our anticapitalism for us, allowing us to continue to consume with impunity. </b>The role of capitalist ideology is not to make an explicit case for something in the way that propaganda does, but to conceal the fact that the operations of capital do not depend on any sort of subjectively assumed belief.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>In essence, consuming content that expresses our desire for change stands in place of acting for change. (I am definitely guilty of this!)</p>\n<p><b>I find my emotions manipulated into reading things that, frankly, do not matter to my life.</b> They are outside my realm of influence, but I have been carried along into caring about them by headlines that enrage. <b>My emotional energy is expended on things that I cannot control</b>, leaving me less for the things that I could have some influence on.</p>\n<h3>We fear not being enough</h3>\n<p>Tricia Hersey argues in <i>Rest is Resistance</i> that “Grind culture has placed fear as our only compass and keeps us frozen in a way that is now a habit.”</p>\n<p>As<a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2024/05/04/scale-requires-deskilling/\"> workers’ skills are devalued</a>, we feel pressure to constantly be learning new ones to make sure we’re still needed by the market. With the rise of the<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10696419-the-precariat\"> precariat class</a> — and more and more workers becoming part of it — performing knowledge acquisition can become more important than actually learning things (have you visited LinkedIn lately). We lean on book summaries, we listen to audio books on 2x, 3x speed so we can fit in more. <b>Unconsciously, </b><b><i>value </i></b><b>becomes the key heuristic for any piece of media we engage with. </b>But it’s toxic to expect that every thing we read deliver market-ready insights, an expectation that erodes the perceived worth of any information that isn’t immediately applicable. We don’t feel we have time to wait for insights to arise naturally, but instead feed ourselves as much information as we can. Bread <em>and</em> roses, went the Labor slogan — this mindset says never mind the flowers.</p>\n<p>Johann Hari <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2023/07/31/read-stolen-focus/\">describes how this feels as a writer</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I fattened myself with information every waking hour to make myself a more productive writer, and I had started to think that the way I lived was a bit like the process where, in a factory farm, a foie gras goose is force-fed gross amounts in order to turn its liver into pâté.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Chris Bailey <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2023/03/24/read-how-to-calm-your-mind/\">identifies this as the accomplishment mindset</a>, which “leads us to always want to fill our time with something — and feel guilty when we’re spending our time in a ‘nonoptimal’ way.” At the root of the mindset? “[O]ur relentless pursuit of <i>more</i>.” In <i>Four Thousand Weeks</i>, Oliver Burkeman writes, “The fundamental problem is that this attitude toward time sets up a rigged game in which it’s <b>impossible ever to feel as though you’re doing well enough</b>.”</p>\n<p>Tara McMullin <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2023/03/08/read-what-works/\">hones in on <b>self-worth</b></a> as the underlying value behind this urge: “We seek validation for our worthiness and usefulness in our families, in our jobs, in our friendships, and even in the quiet moments we call ‘me time.'” More and more, <b>our status – and emotional safety – relies on our online performance to even our offline communities</b>, whether that is via Facebook or LinkedIn.</p>\n<h3>Cultural consumption is participation</h3>\n<p>Much of what we read is for social reasons. I realized recently that <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2024/11/30/the-impact-of-online-writing/\">most individual online writing – not just on social media, but on blogs too – is part of oral culture</a>; we are online to be social, even if that sociality is asynchronous. <b>With fewer non-commercial places to gather, we have less opportunity to simply </b><b><i>be </i></b><b>or </b><b><i>do </i></b><b>with each other, so we go online and </b><b><i>consume </i></b><b>together. </b></p>\n<p>Sarah LaBrie <a href=\"https://1234kyle5678.substack.com/p/memoirs-are-so-hot-rn\">points out that</a> “Reading Cut essays or watching Netflix documentaries is inherently social. They’re written to be consumed and processed online.” <b>Participating in The Discourse is often </b><a href=\"https://www.garbageday.email/p/taylor-swift-vs-manosphere\"><b>part of the fun</b></a> of the internet, and that means keeping up with whatever we’re Discoursing about today.

The indie web is interesting to me both at an individual and community level; that means “keeping up” with the indie web means paying attention to what individual people are doing and talking about, as well as the conversations going on in the community. <b>It’s important to me to stay interconnected with what this group is thinking about and reading</b>.

Now if I want to read on my phone, I can choose between my Read Later app, books on Libby, or PDFs I’ve saved. I want to break my mental association between phone and brain candy. I’m also keeping books scattered all over my house so it’s <b>as easy to grab a book as my phone</b>.</p>\n*(I can get around being logged out but it interrupts the immediate impulse – my friend suggested that if I <em>really</em> want to make it hard to circumvent myself, I could set up my password manager so I don’t have access to social accounts on mobile… haven’t gotten to that point yet ????)<h3>Separate curation from consumption</h3>\n<p>Rach Smith <a href=\"https://rachsmith.com/subscribe-a-lot-consume-a-little/\">describes their philosophy for deciding what to read</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The way I like to do content consumption is to subscribe to many different sources and then be ruthless about which content I actually choose to consume.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>I like how this blends a diversity of sources with a more constrained amount of reading. To put something like this into practice, <strong>I’m not reading articles when I open them</strong>. Instead, I am trying out splitting my reading time into phases:</p>\n<ol><li>Gather</li>\n<li>Collect</li>\n<li>Curate</li>\n<li>Select</li>\n</ol><p>The key benefit of this, for me, is the emotional separation between the time I open an article and the time I decide whether or not to actually read it. <b>Not reading “in the heat of the moment”</b> makes a big difference for me in being able to let things go.</p>\n<p>It also gives me a mental break to refocus on what <em>I</em> want, what <em>I</em> am interested in. It’s not that everything I read must have an obvious value proposition, but acknowledging that I simply cannot read everything, and some pieces of writing will be more valuable to me than others, though that value may be in terms of connection or entertainment, not “practical” benefit. Because I can see all the options for reading at once, it feels more like I’m selecting what to read than simply keeping up.</p>\n<h4>What this looks like in practice</h4>\n<p>My process is inefficient, but I use that to my advantage:</p>\n<ol><li>Select article in my<a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2023/02/07/what-makes-rss-better-than-social-timelines/\"> feed reader</a></li>\n<li>Open it in my browser</li>\n<li>Save it to my read later app (currently Instapaper)</li>\n<li>(Later, preferably the next day) Curate my read later list by tagging and archiving articles</li>\n<li>(Hopefully!) Select what to read around a question or theme</li>\n</ol><p><b>Each time I interact with an article gives me another chance to decide not to read it.</b> Since my problem is having too many options, that’s great. Articles get culled at every stage.</p>\n<p>I am <b>exploiting my own emotional sense of safety</b> with this process – by saving everything to my Read Later app, I have the assurance that I <i>could </i>go pull something out of the archives if I decide later that it was worth reading after all… but I never do ????</p>\n<p>I don’t always follow the process — if I’m reading an article and want to follow a link in it right away, I’ll do that, that’s how hypertext works — but I’m working on being better about <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2022/06/25/decide-before-doing/\">deciding what I’m doing before I do it</a>.</p>\n<h2>How I’m separating curation from consumption</h2>\n<h3>Phase 1: GATHER by subscribing and browsing</h3>\n<p>I start by defining the area of my attention, the pool of information that I’ll choose from. I cast a wide net across <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/blogroll/\">indie web bloggers</a> and microbloggers and curated email newsletters (most of which I follow <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2023/02/07/what-makes-rss-better-than-social-timelines/\">via RSS</a>). I seek book recommendations from bloggers and on Goodreads, plus I’ve found <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2021/09/17/browsing-is-learning/\">browsing</a> through broad search terms at my local library turns up all manner of intriguing options.</p>\n<h3>Phase 2: COLLECT a “long list”</h3>\n<p>Out of the pool of information I gather, I collect a long list of articles and books that sound interesting. I open any articles that sound interesting from my RSS reader in my browser, and skim link roundups to choose which links I want to evaluate further. Often, I’ll skim the first paragraph or scan the shape of the article to get a feel for how long it is and judge whether or not it might be worth reading. When the same article is recommended by a lot of people I follow, it’s probably worth reading, if not on its own merits to understand what people are thinking about.</p>\n<p>I collect:</p>\n<ul><li>articles in my Read-it-Later app</li>\n<li>book recommendations on my Goodreads “someday maybe” shelf, library “For Later” list, and Libby ebook tags</li>\n<li>PDFs in a library on my desktop (ok realistically I don’t move them from my phone to computer that often)</li>\n</ul><h3>Step 3: CURATE a “short list”</h3>\n<p>Once I’m done collecting options for the day, I’ll <b>pare down the long list into a short list</b>. (Even better if I wait till the next day, but at the end of a gathering phase works too.) For articles in my Read Later app, that means either <b>tagging articles</b> for the short list or <b>archiving </b>ones that I don’t really need to read (inspired by Alex’s<a href=\"https://alexsirac.com/improving-our-relationship-to-news/\"> Improving our relationship to news</a>).</p>\n<p>At this stage, I use length as a proxy for depth and <b>prefer medium to long articles</b> over short pieces – the Read Later app gives me an estimated reading time that’s helpful for comparing options. The exception here is posts by individual bloggers, who often write shorter posts than verbose Substackers.</p>\n<p>As a blogger, another consideration is whether the article’s about something I’d like to write about. A lot of my blogging happens in response to what I read, so <b>choosing what I read is another way of </b><a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2023/05/19/a-note-gathering-and-idea-making-process/\"><b>choosing what I’m going to blog about</b></a>.</p>\n<p>I move books from my Goodreads “someday maybe ” shelf to my “want to read” shelf. I batch library runs for once or twice a month, and think of each pickup as<a href=\"https://notes.tracydurnell.com/categories/reading/\"> a collection</a>. (I don’t expect myself to read every book I borrow.) As I’m choosing which books to request, I <b>think of it as a menu</b> – I want different options for different tastes and mindsets. I try to <b>address a variety of my reading needs: learning, inspiration, entertainment</b>. I don’t want to order a bunch of heavy stuff all at once.</p>\n<a href=\"https://notes.tracydurnell.com/2024/07/11/heavy-on-the.html\"><img src=\"https://tracydurnell.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/library-hoard-July-2024.jpg\" alt=\"stack of library books, many of them comics\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" /></a>a sample <a href=\"https://notes.tracydurnell.com/2024/07/11/heavy-on-the.html\">library haul</a>: two prose books, three art books, a cookbook, and five comics<p>(You’ll notice I don’t have a process yet for sorting and reading PDFs… that’s a spring project ????)</p>\n<h3>Step 4: SELECT what to actually read</h3>\n<p>Finally, I’ll choose from my short list of articles or menu of library books. This lets me decide before I start reading <b>whether I am reading to be social, to learn, or to be entertained</b>.</p>\n<p>As I’m deciding what to read, I try to:</p>\n<ul><li>relate back to my<a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/questions/\"> <b>Big Questions</b></a> and blog posts I’m currently writing</li>\n<li>embrace <b>curiosity and fun</b></li>\n<li>get <b>context and analysis</b> on current events</li>\n<li>keep up on <b>conversations in the indie web</b></li>\n</ul><p>I’ve been working on <strong>listening to my excitement, following wherever whim leads me</strong>. Sometimes that means gambling on a cultural work without doing a ton of research. Earlier this month, I read an interesting quote by Roland Barthes, noticed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pleasure_of_the_Text\">the book it came from</a> had an intriguing title, ordered a used copy on Better World Books, and now I’ve read half of what’s turned out to be a much more philosophical treatise on pleasure than I imagined ???? But I’m glad I didn’t get scared off! The indulgent, uninhibited prose alone is worth the price of entry ???? While I was looking it up, I saw <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58034952-the-pleasure-of-the-text\">another book with the same title</a> had a totally bonkers cover, and they had a copy for $5, so I said why not??? I’ve been thinking a lot about how oral culture applies to the internet, so I thought I might re-read <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/oralityliteracyt0000ongw\"><em>Orality and Literacy</em></a> — when I looked it up, another title popped up that was <em><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13697055-oral-tradition-and-the-internet\">specifically about oral culture on the internet</a></em>???? and there was a single used copy left, so I took it as kismet and ordered it too ???? <strong>This whole process has felt *alive*.</strong> We’ll see how it goes when I’m back to work, but for now I am Digging It.</p>\n<p>I’ve only started using this process over the past few weeks, but so far it’s working almost exactly how I want.

      "text": "This is part three of a series on tackling wants, managing my media diet, and finding enough. Read the introduction on “the mindset of more.”\nThe Internet feels like an old relative’s hoarder house, the hallways so packed with clutter you can barely squeeze through. At one point they remembered where some of the important things were, but not anymore. You already can’t find anything beneath the junk mail, and the mismatched mass of stuff all blends together into one — at this point you’d be thrilled to uncover their collection of chipped Hummel figurines simply for the sake of coherence — and you also can’t stop them from bringing more shit home.\nI find myself collecting an informational hoard, amassing articles in my read-it-later app and piling books onto my TBR. The more information I’m exposed to, the more I realize how little I know, and the more I feel compelled to patch this deficit. I hunger for the new; even when I have plenty of articles saved to Instapaper, my default action is to gather more. Who knows what I might miss if I don’t check what’s new? What if there’s a better article, a better book, a better explanation to be found?\n\nCurator Hans Ulrich Oberst notes that for most of history, scarcity was the challenge; now, overproduction is. Today, the pace that new content is flung at us means that, without substantial willpower or intentionality, we’re so busy consuming we don’t have time to think. Trying to keep up means we rarely take the time to step back and think about what we’re keeping up with. Dependent on pageviews for advertising revenue, publications pull every trick in the book to steal our attention. My own curiosities are swamped by the neverending pile of information dumped on my mental threshold each day.\nNB: in this post, I’m mostly talking about non-fiction books and articles online, though I also find my phone gets in the way of reading fiction sometimes too!\nOver the past couple years, I’ve tracked everything I read in a day several times. This gave me a better understanding of what I was reading, and how much I could actually read in a day — it’s less than I expected. Depending on length, it might be as few as five articles, or if I spend an entire Saturday lounging around reading the internet, as many as twenty articles. Let’s call it an average of fifteen. This knowledge alone has been enough to jolt me out of reading some stuff that was obviously attention bait – is this worth one of my fifteen reading slots for the day? (Reading for entertainment isn’t bad, I just want to do so intentionally.)\nInformation acts as a modern enchantment, keeping us in its sway. When I decide to read, I instinctively pick up my phone instead of a book. And as much as I think online writing is valuable and important, some writing is higher quality than others. (I don’t mean quality at the prose level, more impact. Because I also get annoyed by fancified writing that overcomplicates itself — I’ve learned to steer clear of literary reviews ????) I seem to gravitate towards the same kind of Substack personal essay, so if I unthinkingly read whatever has emotional pull, when I emerge from the haze, I realize I’ve read several interchangeable vibes pieces that I couldn’t tell you who wrote.\nI want to escape emotional manipulation and choose what I invest my limited time in more intentionally. If I notice I’m interested in a particular topic, I want to seek out and read higher quality material about it – more books! more complicated books! – when I have the mental energy. In essence, I want to replace my “mental junk food” binge habit with more thoughtful reading.\nAs I’ve practiced being more intentional about what I read, I’ve honed in on a few filters for myself:\nThree “rules” for attention\nChoose what to read based on my interest, not “to be an informed person”\nBe skeptical of titles that invoke fear; be wary of articles framed to make me feel superior to others\nPrioritize information that will directly impact my life or community; pay less attention to news outside my control\nI still fall for things that break these rules all the time, but having them has helped me turn down a lot of reading in favor of better options for me.\nWhy we feel the need to consume more\nMy friend pointed out that our appetites developed in an age of scarcity, when we needed to consume as much as we could find, and more information was always better. We weren’t made to resist information, and our brains reward us for feeding ourselves more, even if those intellectual calories turn out to be hollow. In a world of scarcity, easy calories were a better choice than hard-to-get ones — but the information that’s easiest to come by is often the lowest quality, or worse, manipulative.\nUnderstanding the emotional forces that influence what I decide to read is my first step towards asserting control over what information I spend my time and mental energy on.\nInformation makes us feel in control\nHaley Nahman recognizes how our consumption habits assuage our anxiety: “There are infinite resources available to quell our voids.” Having the theoretical ability to have information makes us feel like we need it. Yet our anxiety “isn’t caused by a lack of answers to [our] swirl of questions, but the swirl itself.” I have anxiety, and our modern information system seems tailor-made to feed off and amplify my worries.\nUltimately, the reason we keep gathering information is that we conflate being informed with being in control. With enough knowledge, we’ll never lose our jobs, we’ll keep ourselves and our loved ones safe, we’ll know how to survive if the government really starts rounding up leftists. Knowing what’s going on in D.C. at every moment becomes a way to feel that we are participating, believe that we understand what’s happening, and assure ourselves that we will be able to react to whatever happens.\nGathering information substitutes knowledge for action. In Capitalist Realism, Mark Fisher describes the concept of interpassivity:\n“A film like Wall-E exemplifies what Robert Pfaller has called ‘interpassivity’: the film performs our anticapitalism for us, allowing us to continue to consume with impunity. The role of capitalist ideology is not to make an explicit case for something in the way that propaganda does, but to conceal the fact that the operations of capital do not depend on any sort of subjectively assumed belief.”\nIn essence, consuming content that expresses our desire for change stands in place of acting for change. (I am definitely guilty of this!)\nI find my emotions manipulated into reading things that, frankly, do not matter to my life. They are outside my realm of influence, but I have been carried along into caring about them by headlines that enrage. My emotional energy is expended on things that I cannot control, leaving me less for the things that I could have some influence on.\nWe fear not being enough\nTricia Hersey argues in Rest is Resistance that “Grind culture has placed fear as our only compass and keeps us frozen in a way that is now a habit.”\nAs workers’ skills are devalued, we feel pressure to constantly be learning new ones to make sure we’re still needed by the market. With the rise of the precariat class — and more and more workers becoming part of it — performing knowledge acquisition can become more important than actually learning things (have you visited LinkedIn lately). We lean on book summaries, we listen to audio books on 2x, 3x speed so we can fit in more. Unconsciously, value becomes the key heuristic for any piece of media we engage with. But it’s toxic to expect that every thing we read deliver market-ready insights, an expectation that erodes the perceived worth of any information that isn’t immediately applicable. We don’t feel we have time to wait for insights to arise naturally, but instead feed ourselves as much information as we can. Bread and roses, went the Labor slogan — this mindset says never mind the flowers.\nJohann Hari describes how this feels as a writer:\n“I fattened myself with information every waking hour to make myself a more productive writer, and I had started to think that the way I lived was a bit like the process where, in a factory farm, a foie gras goose is force-fed gross amounts in order to turn its liver into pâté.”\nChris Bailey identifies this as the accomplishment mindset, which “leads us to always want to fill our time with something — and feel guilty when we’re spending our time in a ‘nonoptimal’ way.” At the root of the mindset? “[O]ur relentless pursuit of more.” In Four Thousand Weeks, Oliver Burkeman writes, “The fundamental problem is that this attitude toward time sets up a rigged game in which it’s impossible ever to feel as though you’re doing well enough.”\nTara McMullin hones in on self-worth as the underlying value behind this urge: “We seek validation for our worthiness and usefulness in our families, in our jobs, in our friendships, and even in the quiet moments we call ‘me time.'” More and more, our status – and emotional safety – relies on our online performance to even our offline communities, whether that is via Facebook or LinkedIn.\nCultural consumption is participation\nMuch of what we read is for social reasons. I realized recently that most individual online writing – not just on social media, but on blogs too – is part of oral culture; we are online to be social, even if that sociality is asynchronous. With fewer non-commercial places to gather, we have less opportunity to simply be or do with each other, so we go online and consume together. \nSarah LaBrie points out that “Reading Cut essays or watching Netflix documentaries is inherently social. They’re written to be consumed and processed online.” Participating in The Discourse is often part of the fun of the internet, and that means keeping up with whatever we’re Discoursing about today. We feel like we must have an opinion about everything (but we don’t). We don’t want to feel left out of the loop, the internet equivalent of fake laughing along with the reference we didn’t get.\nParticipating in shared culture is part of fitting in: looking the part, speaking the lingo, getting the references. Josh Lauer writes: “The imperative to participate—as media users, content creators and curators, and members of virtual communities—has become a defining aspect of digital life.” We choose what we do and which cultural and knowledge works we consume in part based on the cultures we consider ourselves part of. But the internet keeps us tuned in closer with the cultural consumption of more people from different parts of our lives, building higher demands to keep up with what all our friends, family, professional contacts, and influencers for our self-selected subcultures are reading, watching, listening to, talking about. Keeping up requires more.\nOur connections become mediated through social features on websites like Goodreads, encouraging us to consume what our friends are. Consumption becomes participation in culture. As Julia Alexander puts it (emphasis mine):\n“I was thinking about the gamification of our leisure time earlier this week while talking to a friend who’s an executive at an entertainment company lamenting that they didn’t have enough time to keep up with any trend over the last couple years let alone new ones. A new superstar actor who debuted in a Netflix movie? Didn’t want to keep up, but the movie was all over Instagram. The latest book flying off the shelves? Not a big reader but their favorite podcaster said it’s what everyone is obsessing over. Connection is consumption, and consumption is quantifiable.”\nOn the corporate web, the growth mindset has been insinuated into activities we used to do just for fun. Turning leisure activities into obligations stole the pleasure of nonproduction from our free time.\nChoosing who influences us\nAdapting to the people “around us” isn’t a bad thing, it’s just something to be aware of: who are we allowing to influence us? Celine Nguyen writes about how we can use the dynamics of influence to act on ourselves by choosing who we spend time around and which rabbit holes we dive down:\n“A lot has been written about how the internet radicalizes people. But the same dynamics that turn a slightly lonely young man into a seething misogynist—recommendation algorithms; social contexts that concentrate and intensify discourse—are also the dynamics that turn a young person who “likes reading” into someone who spends a year reading Proust, and then the next two years trying to find friends who want to reread Proust together.”\nI’ve chosen to be active in the indie web community, an affinity network with a shared interest in the open web. I follow lots of other bloggers, participate in the IndieWeb Carnival, write about the indie web and cross-post articles to IndieNews, and attend IndieWeb events. The indie web is interesting to me both at an individual and community level; that means “keeping up” with the indie web means paying attention to what individual people are doing and talking about, as well as the conversations going on in the community. It’s important to me to stay interconnected with what this group is thinking about and reading. I’ve put a lot of thought into building connections within the indie web, and count participating in community conversations a factor in what I choose to write about. I have intentionally chosen how involved I want to be in the indie web community, and I like the places the indie web has taken me.\nI think the indie web is a pretty healthy place to be influenced by others – for me it’s led to cool stuff like incorporating a heart reacji on my website after Benji set it up to share and adding series to my site after Chris set them up on his. Interactions on the indie web amplify creation, instead of consumption; the concept of “scenius” describes how network effects can multiply creativity in an area, which I’m applying to the digital space too. Hypertext, where the ideas live “somewhere inside the network”, feels like a natural environment for this type of collaborative, community thinking. The indie web is a group of people I like to think with.\nHow to climb out of the information pit\nThe philosophical approach to escaping the endless information pit that is the internet: learn to accept uncertainty.\nTrust yourself to make decisions with imperfect information. Stop looking for external validation, and find meaning outside of work. Believe in your skills, your value, and your ability to adapt to changing situations. Accept that some things, even important things, are out of your control.\n(In case it isn’t clear, I’m talking to myself here ????)\nLearning to live with uncertainty gets at the foundational fear of wanting to know it will all work out, but is very hard — probably a life-long endeavor.\nMore practically, you can change how you read. (I’m using reading as my example because I like reading and don’t like video, but the philosophy applies to both.) This is also hard, but easy in comparison to changing your mindset*. You have to make yourself put down the shovel, though; the pit is big enough already.\n*(Not that it’s not worth doing the work — it is — but taking tangible action is a good first step ????)Disrupt the reading environment\nWe must disrupt our patterns of behavior if we truly want to change. Aline Holzwarth describes a law of human behavior that keeps us doing what we’re doing:\n“People tend to stick to the status quo unless the forces of friction or fuel push us off of our path; behavior is a function of the person and their environment…”\nIt might seem like going cold turkey on info is the answer, but the science of behavior change suggests that replacing a bad habit with a better one is often more effective than trying to quit outright.\nWell-intentioned time limits on browsing won’t solve the problem – as Simone points out, “It’s not about how much you use your phone. It’s about whether your phone is a needy, attention-sucking vampire.” And mine is.\nOr, it was.\nIn the past few weeks, I’ve changed the way I read so I only have access to higher quality reading material on my phone, which is where I tend to veg and slip into a mindless scroll. I deleted my feed reader app, logged out of BlueSky*, and deleted my microblogging client. Now if I want to read on my phone, I can choose between my Read Later app, books on Libby, or PDFs I’ve saved. I want to break my mental association between phone and brain candy. I’m also keeping books scattered all over my house so it’s as easy to grab a book as my phone.\n*(I can get around being logged out but it interrupts the immediate impulse – my friend suggested that if I really want to make it hard to circumvent myself, I could set up my password manager so I don’t have access to social accounts on mobile… haven’t gotten to that point yet ????)Separate curation from consumption\nRach Smith describes their philosophy for deciding what to read:\n“The way I like to do content consumption is to subscribe to many different sources and then be ruthless about which content I actually choose to consume.”\nI like how this blends a diversity of sources with a more constrained amount of reading. To put something like this into practice, I’m not reading articles when I open them. Instead, I am trying out splitting my reading time into phases:\nGather\nCollect\nCurate\nSelect\nThe key benefit of this, for me, is the emotional separation between the time I open an article and the time I decide whether or not to actually read it. Not reading “in the heat of the moment” makes a big difference for me in being able to let things go.\nIt also gives me a mental break to refocus on what I want, what I am interested in. It’s not that everything I read must have an obvious value proposition, but acknowledging that I simply cannot read everything, and some pieces of writing will be more valuable to me than others, though that value may be in terms of connection or entertainment, not “practical” benefit. Because I can see all the options for reading at once, it feels more like I’m selecting what to read than simply keeping up.\nWhat this looks like in practice\nMy process is inefficient, but I use that to my advantage:\nSelect article in my feed reader\nOpen it in my browser\nSave it to my read later app (currently Instapaper)\n(Later, preferably the next day) Curate my read later list by tagging and archiving articles\n(Hopefully!) Select what to read around a question or theme\nEach time I interact with an article gives me another chance to decide not to read it. Since my problem is having too many options, that’s great. Articles get culled at every stage.\nI am exploiting my own emotional sense of safety with this process – by saving everything to my Read Later app, I have the assurance that I could go pull something out of the archives if I decide later that it was worth reading after all… but I never do ????\nI don’t always follow the process — if I’m reading an article and want to follow a link in it right away, I’ll do that, that’s how hypertext works — but I’m working on being better about deciding what I’m doing before I do it.\nHow I’m separating curation from consumption\nPhase 1: GATHER by subscribing and browsing\nI start by defining the area of my attention, the pool of information that I’ll choose from. I cast a wide net across indie web bloggers and microbloggers and curated email newsletters (most of which I follow via RSS). I seek book recommendations from bloggers and on Goodreads, plus I’ve found browsing through broad search terms at my local library turns up all manner of intriguing options.\nPhase 2: COLLECT a “long list”\nOut of the pool of information I gather, I collect a long list of articles and books that sound interesting. I open any articles that sound interesting from my RSS reader in my browser, and skim link roundups to choose which links I want to evaluate further. Often, I’ll skim the first paragraph or scan the shape of the article to get a feel for how long it is and judge whether or not it might be worth reading. When the same article is recommended by a lot of people I follow, it’s probably worth reading, if not on its own merits to understand what people are thinking about.\nI collect:\narticles in my Read-it-Later app\nbook recommendations on my Goodreads “someday maybe” shelf, library “For Later” list, and Libby ebook tags\nPDFs in a library on my desktop (ok realistically I don’t move them from my phone to computer that often)\nStep 3: CURATE a “short list”\nOnce I’m done collecting options for the day, I’ll pare down the long list into a short list. (Even better if I wait till the next day, but at the end of a gathering phase works too.) For articles in my Read Later app, that means either tagging articles for the short list or archiving ones that I don’t really need to read (inspired by Alex’s Improving our relationship to news).\nAt this stage, I use length as a proxy for depth and prefer medium to long articles over short pieces – the Read Later app gives me an estimated reading time that’s helpful for comparing options. The exception here is posts by individual bloggers, who often write shorter posts than verbose Substackers.\nAs a blogger, another consideration is whether the article’s about something I’d like to write about. A lot of my blogging happens in response to what I read, so choosing what I read is another way of choosing what I’m going to blog about.\nI move books from my Goodreads “someday maybe ” shelf to my “want to read” shelf. I batch library runs for once or twice a month, and think of each pickup as a collection. (I don’t expect myself to read every book I borrow.) As I’m choosing which books to request, I think of it as a menu – I want different options for different tastes and mindsets. I try to address a variety of my reading needs: learning, inspiration, entertainment. I don’t want to order a bunch of heavy stuff all at once.\na sample library haul: two prose books, three art books, a cookbook, and five comics(You’ll notice I don’t have a process yet for sorting and reading PDFs… that’s a spring project ????)\nStep 4: SELECT what to actually read\nFinally, I’ll choose from my short list of articles or menu of library books. This lets me decide before I start reading whether I am reading to be social, to learn, or to be entertained.\nAs I’m deciding what to read, I try to:\nrelate back to my Big Questions and blog posts I’m currently writing\nembrace curiosity and fun\nget context and analysis on current events\nkeep up on conversations in the indie web\nI’ve been working on listening to my excitement, following wherever whim leads me. Sometimes that means gambling on a cultural work without doing a ton of research. Earlier this month, I read an interesting quote by Roland Barthes, noticed the book it came from had an intriguing title, ordered a used copy on Better World Books, and now I’ve read half of what’s turned out to be a much more philosophical treatise on pleasure than I imagined ???? But I’m glad I didn’t get scared off! The indulgent, uninhibited prose alone is worth the price of entry ???? While I was looking it up, I saw another book with the same title had a totally bonkers cover, and they had a copy for $5, so I said why not??? I’ve been thinking a lot about how oral culture applies to the internet, so I thought I might re-read Orality and Literacy — when I looked it up, another title popped up that was specifically about oral culture on the internet???? and there was a single used copy left, so I took it as kismet and ordered it too ???? This whole process has felt *alive*. We’ll see how it goes when I’m back to work, but for now I am Digging It.\nI’ve only started using this process over the past few weeks, but so far it’s working almost exactly how I want. This is what I’m trying to manage my information diet, and I can’t promise it’ll work for anyone else — but I know I’m not the only one thinking about what I read right now.\n \nFurther reading:\nRethinking Reading by Steve Makofsky\nIntention economy by Nick Simson\nWe really like personal sites but the internet has been turning into poisonous garbage at an alarming rate by Ním Daghlian\n \nSee also:\nThe TBR Stream"
