We had conversation about it on a couple of Homebrew website clubs, there was a session <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/2023/SD/movieviewings\">about it on San Diego IndieWeb Camp</a> and we had a conversation about it through our site (starting with <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/2023/12/the-chicken-egg-problem-of-movie-microformats/\">this</a> and currently, probably finished, <a href=\"https://www.benji.dog/notes/1702277465/\">here</a>). </p>\n<p>If I understood his idea, his idea was more a feed of movies that people were watching. And the review aggregator. Now, I do post the <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/movies-and-series/\">list of movies I watched</a>, but I don't do separate posts and I don't do reviews or rating. After this project, I could be convinced otherwise on the reviews, but still don't want to put the numerical rating on it. </p>\n<p>But I found the idea of finding the common interest interesting. Could this be used to see, if some people are watching common movies? What I would be even more interested is to see, if there are some common books we are reading. </p>\n<p>But unlike with books, where I do read books outside of Goodreads, Open Library or Google Books, and even with the ISBN numbers, there does not seems to be a good way to connect different editions and different translations and so on. Open Library is having this data for the books in their database. It seems that this problem would require some more work.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I have yet to watch the movie, that was not in the <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/\">IMDB (Internet Movie Database)</a>. So as long as I could sort of map it to there, I would have a way to connect movies for different members.</p>\n<h3>The First Proof of Concept</h3>\n<p>So I have created the <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/projects/indieweb-movies/\">first proof of concept</a> to see, if anybody is even interested in this. </p>\n<p>It had the three parts to it. </p>\n<p>The first part is the <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/projects/indieweb-movies/network.html\">network representation of the common movies</a>. It does require JavaScript, so for the people that have it blocked, here is the current picture.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"common movies between 5 indieweb members\" src=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/content/images/2023/movies-network.png\" /></p>\n<p>It simply shows either just the common movies or all the movies, and it is possible to filter by IMDB genre. Something that looks pretty. It was also the idea I started with, which is why it stayed the part of it.</p>\n<p>The second one is some <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/projects/indieweb-movies/stats.html\">general statistics</a>. It starts with the leader board of the common movies. I was a bit surprised, that it was Enola Holmes who was the most watched movie. Not the best movie I watched this year, but also not the worst movie I watched this year.</p>\n<p>After that, there are some general statistics of the movie based on the IMDB metadata. I found two things interesting: the year distribution of the movies (the oldest movie watched was from 1900) and the country distribution (we hit all the continents sans Antarctica). </p>\n<p>Though it also made me realise all the problems I have with the IMDB metadata.</p>\n<p>The third one is the <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/projects/indieweb-movies/posters.html\">posters page</a>. It just lists the posters of the watched movies, with the list of people that watched it underneath. </p>\n<p>It also allows filtering by the IMDB metadata. Currently one can only filter by one thing at the time. Just some playing.</p>\n<p>If you want to see the representation of my problem with the IMDB metadata, then just try to filter the movies by country Japan. It includes a lot of movies, that I would not put there, as I would not consider them Japanese movies. But it is easily accessible, so it is there.</p>\n<h3>Technical Background</h3>\n<p>It is a statically generated site. In the background it is this <a href=\"https://sarajaksa.eu/projects/indieweb-movies/Movies%20Analysis.ipynb\">jupyter notebook</a>. I have used <a href=\"https://omdbapi.com/\">OMDb API</a> in the background to get movies metadata and to try to recognise the movies in the posts, that do not have the IMDB URLs in their watched movies list. </p>\n<p>To update the data, I need to run this code locally. So in updates on the sporadic timetable. </p>\n<h3>Thanks to the Early Participants</h3>\n<p>I would here like to thank <a href=\"https://www.benji.dog/\">Benji</a>, <a href=\"https://www.jeremycherfas.net/\">Jeremy</a>, <a href=\"https://marksuth.dev/\">Mark</a> and <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com\">Tracy</a> to give me permission to scrape their data and use it in this project. </p>\n<h3>Volunteer for Participation</h3>\n<p>If you want to have your data included in this project, please <a href=\"mailto:sarajaksa@sarajaksa.eu\">contact me</a>. I prefer to not use the data from somebody else without their permission. Lets us try to be more ethical then the current tech industry. :)</p>\n<p>Also, at least two people pointed me to the better source of movies on their site. Without it, I would have listed a smaller amount of movies for them.</p>\n<h3>Future Ideas</h3>\n<p>Surprisingly, it was the poster page, that had so far provided the most utility to me. It reminded me of the movies that I wanted to watch, but did not yet. And I could check, if they have the DVDs for them in the library. </p>\n<p>In the last year <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/2022/Pop-ups/Personal_Libraries\">pop up about libraries on the websites</a>, there was the idea of the book club. If we could find the common books that multiple people wanted to read, we could have an IndieWeb-like book club. Or something in this direction? And if I could parse the want-to-read book in the same way, it would be possible to see is there are any common books. Or if done with the already read books, to be able to have book discussions?</p>\n<p>And I guess the same could be done with movies? I am in one of the group, that does online groups movie watching, so if somebody would be interested in that, this could also be possible? In this case, I would also need to be parsing people's want-to-watch movies list. Do somebody even post this on their websites?</p>\n<h3>Any Feedback?</h3>\n<p>But honestly, I would be happy for some feedback. Is this something, that is interesting? Could you see a use case for something like that?
