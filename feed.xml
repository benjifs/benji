			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being a huge movie fan, I've really enjoyed listening to the podcast <a href="https://play.acast.com/s/filmstobeburiedwith">Films To Be Buried With</a>. Whenever I listen to an episode I always think I have some answers to the questions <a href="https://imdb.com/name/nm2073429/">Brett Goldstein</a> asks the guests.</p>
<p>The basic premise of the podcast if you haven't listened to it is the following: You have died and go to heaven and people there want to know about your life through film. The following are the questions that are asked with my answers.</p>
<h2>1. First film you remember seeing</h2>
<p>My grandmother had a laserdisc copy of <a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt0096895/">Batman (1989)</a> and while I don't remember sitting down and watching it, I do remember asking to watch it and some images here and there. My first movie theater experience I remember was <a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt0112642/">Casper (1995)</a>.</p>
<h2>2. Scariest film you've ever seen</h2>
<p>I'm not a huge fan of horror films but I have watched a few in my time. <a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt0070047/">The Exorcist (1973)</a> is amazing and I remember the whole watching experience when I was about 12 years old.</p>
<p>While not really a horror movie, <a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt0180093/">Requiem for a Dream (2000)</a> scared me more than anything else I have ever seen. I've watched it once but I still remember every detail of that movie and even though I consider it to be a great film, I'll probably never watch it again.</p>
<h2>3. The film that made you cry the most</h2>
<p>My wife will say I'm not a sad movie crier and instead a happy movie crier. The saddest movie I watched is probably <a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt0095327/">Grave of the Fireflies (1988)</a> but I dont remember crying. I might just not remember because of how many other emotions I had at the end of that movie.</p>
<p>There's a lot of movies designed to make you happy cry and whatever that genre is called, I approve. The speech at the end of <a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt0116695/">Jerry Maguire (1996)</a> always gets me and even though I know its coming every time I watch this, I still can't help but tear up listening to it.</p>
<h2>4. Critically bad film that you love</h2>
<p>I rewatch <a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt0113243/">Hackers (1995)</a> at least once a year. It has a 32% rotten tomatoes and 6.2/10 on IMDB which I've never understood. Even in the past few years I feel like there has been a larger group of people that have gone from liking the movie ironically to actually enjoying it. I watched this in '98 and have been hooked since. I think people get caught up with the way the hacking scenes are shown but even then knowing how unrealistic it was, it made sense as to why they're doing it. Typing code is visually boring and in a movie with so much flashy sets and costumes, showing a black terminal with white text while realistic would not have matched well with the rest of the aesthetic. I also miss payphones and floppy disks and there's plenty of both here.</p>
<h2>5. Film you loved ages ago but you watched recently and it's not that great</h2>
<p>It's been a while so &quot;recently&quot; isn't entirely accurate but I think it would have to be <a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt0088000/">Revenge of the Nerds (1984)</a>. This movie played consistently on TV when I was a younger and I would watch it whenever that would happen. The musical bit near the end was one of my favorite parts. It wasn't until a few years ago me and some friends found we all shared similar nostalgic feelings towards this movie so planned for a movie night and while watching it we realize just how much horrible stuff is actually happening. <strong>The 80's were weird</strong>.</p>
<h2>6. Film with a lot of meaning to you, given the circumstances of the viewing</h2>
<p>Right after highschool but before moving to the US for university my friends and I would go to the movies weekly. Tuesdays were 2 for 1 so pretty good deal even considering the cost of movie tickets in Ecuador back then. The last movie we watched before we all moved away to different cities was <a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt0388795/">Brokeback Mountain (2005)</a>. I love that movie for a million reasons but it also holds all the memories of a very specific moment in my life which I'll always cherish.</p>
<h2>7. Sexiest film you've ever seen</h2>
<p>The obvious answer here has to be <a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt0245574/">Y tu mamá también (2001)</a>. Even if you skip all the sex scenes its hard not to find the rest of the movie sexy. On top of that, to me this has one of the greatest movie endings of all time.</p>
<p>The less obvious answer (which is also part of the questions asked in the podcast) is <a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt2883512/">Chef (2014)</a>. Watch the Pasta Aglio e Olio scene and tell me I'm wrong.</p>
<h2>8. Most relatable film</h2>
<p>This was one of the ones I knew the answer for sure and it was <a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt0800039/">Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008)</a>. Its not a feeling I relate to now but for the longest I really felt a very specific way that this movie depicted fairly accurately. That was true until I watched <a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt19770238/">Aftersun (2022)</a>. I don't want to get into spoilers since this is fairly new but I can see myself in both characters at different times of my life and theirs.</p>
<h2>9. Film that made you laugh the most</h2>
<p>There wasn't a movie theater in the city I grew up in but whenever we would visit Guayaquil my mom, brother, and I went to the movies. One of these times we picked <a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt0364725/">Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004)</a>. The &quot;If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball!&quot; scene caught me completely off guard and when it happened I lost it. It helps that I laugh silently so at least I wasn't annoying people but breathing is important and that was very difficult.</p>
<h2>10. Worst film of all time</h2>
<p>A friend recommended I watch <a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt0368226/">The Room (2003)</a> as they had just been to one of the midnight shows and had loved the experience. It was pitched to me like a movie that's so bad its funny but I think it benefits from a crowd. Watching this alone on my laptop is about the saddest movie watching experience and nothing at all was funny or interesting to me. I've watched some bad movies but this one is rough.</p>
<h2>11. Objectively best film of all time</h2>
<p>I think most answers here could be cliche and be right so mine is just an example of that. <a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt0088763/">Back to the Future (1985)</a> is a perfect movie and I don't think I even have to say anything else.</p>
<h2>12. Film you could watch again and again</h2>
<p>My wife and I have different movie tastes but we usually try to watch <a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt0119116/">The Fifth Element (1997)</a> and <a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt3748528/">Rogue One (2016)</a> at least once a year. I think its impossible to get tired of watching The Fifth Element. Fun SciFi movie with a great cast and music and the attention to detail in the world built for it always has me feeling like I'm seeing new things for the first time.</p>
<h2>13. Film to be buried with</h2>
<p><a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt0844286/">The Brothers Bloom (2008)</a> could easily answer most of the other questions from above but I felt like this would be best for the end. It has a wonderful cast, magic, crime, a sibling relationship, mystery, romance, comedy, friendship. I'm sure there are many flaws with it but the good things in this movie are really good to me and I would hope sharing it through this medium might help others see it much the same way.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>That's my list. I've had this in multiple states of drafted since I talked about this over a year ago at a <a href="https://indieweb.org/Homebrew_Website_Club">Homebrew Website Club</a> meeting and I'm happy I've finally finished it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Tea culture in the UK was always fascinating to me so a few years ago I spent some time trying to learn how to make a proper cup of tea. I'm not sure if I got there but I sometimes will have my version of that as a treat.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<title>How I Rate Movies</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've had this post drafted for a bit and after reading <a href="https://rknight.me/no-more-ratings/">Robb Knight's post</a> about their movie rating system, I thought it's about time I finish and post it.</p>
<p>I like watching movies and I try to watch a lot of movies. For the past few years I've been using <a href="https://letterboxd.com/benji">Letterboxd</a> to track movies I watch. I didn't rate for a long time because I thought it was pointless and the rating only really applies to me but then quite a few times I found myself rewatching a movie that I had already watched because I didn't remember what I thought about it or completely forgot that I watched it.</p>
<p>The main motivation for me building a <a href="https://sparkles.sploot.com/">micropub client</a> was so that I could track my movie <a href="https://benji.dog/watched">watch</a> history on my site and move away from Letterboxd. I used to take a few days to log a movie on Letterboxd mostly out of forgetfulness but having my own client that I need to test makes me log movies sooner.</p>
<p>This rating system was created so that I could remind myself generally what I thought about the movie without having to write a review and more importantly, make it easy to know whether I thought something was worth coming back to later. It doesn't always make sense but it works for me.</p>
<p>Here's roughly how I rate movies:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>★★★ is the baseline score. This is where all movies start.</li>
<li>Every time I wish I was doing anything else, the movie drops ½.</li>
<li>★★★½ if I think the movie is worth a rewatch.</li>
<li>★★★★ is a great movie but I probably won't be coming back to it.</li>
<li>★★★★½ is great AND rewatchable.</li>
<li>★★★★★ is a perfect movie or it means something to me.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Rating something under ★★★ is rare and it doesn't speak to the quality of the film as much of whether or not it was able to interest me.</p>
<p>Fun data: 908 movies rated (Last updated 2023-02-15)</p>

<p><a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/h-review">h-review</a> works but if you're not adding a rating or review then it should be an <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry">h-entry</a> with a <a href="https://github.com/microformats/h-entry/issues/17">u-watch-of</a>.</p>
<p>But maybe all logs should be an <code>h-entry</code> and if theres a review it should also post an <code>h-review</code>.</p>
<p>Another issue for me with <code>h-review</code> is that it will need a tag (or category) to mark it as a movie, book, or anything else.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I haven't done one of these before and also don't think I have the discipline to do these often. Still, I thought it would be fun to try and recap what happened and what I did in 2022.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Personal</h2>
<p><em><strong>A</strong></em> (wife), <em><strong>O</strong></em> (kid), and I have been in our house for 2 years now. This year also marks our house's 100th year from when it was built which is ridiculous to even think about. There's a lot of cool info I was able to find in public library records about the house including some pictures of it from a long time ago.</p>
<p>We've had friends and family visit us this past year which has been nice as travelling with a toddler by plane still feels very scary to me. We have a list of places where we think would be a good place to travel with <em><strong>O</strong></em> but haven't settled on anything yet.</p>
<h2>Code</h2>
<p>I took on a few more responsibilities at work including the backend of some of the applications I work with. I hadn't looked at Java code in a bit but it felt quite natural coming back to it after all these years.</p>
<p>Outside of work duties I have been working a little more on some personal projects. The big thing I worked on this year was a <a href="https://sparkles.sploot.com/">micropub client called sparkles</a>. This was a project I had started, trashed, and restarted a few times but was committed to getting it to some state of completeness this year. I also did some minor changes to my <a href="https://github.com/benjifs/micropub">micropub endpoint</a>. I keep debating naming this something but haven't quite decided what to do there.</p>
<p>One last project that I started working on was an <a href="https://indieauth.net/">indieauth and token</a> endpoint to switch away from <a href="https://indieauth.com/">indieauth.com</a>. I keep hearing about plans to possibly deprecate IndieAuth and this also seems like the next logical step of <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a> related projects for me to work on.</p>
<h2>Movies</h2>
<p>I miss going to the movies but I'm still very cautious with indoor spaces where others are unmasked. I only saw three movies in theaters this year but hoping that changes in 2023.</p>
<p>This year I <a href="https://benji.dog/watched">watched</a> 138 movies (100 new and 38 rewatched).</p>
<p>That's 5 less movies than <a href="https://letterboxd.com/benji/films/diary/for/2021/">2021</a> but 22 more new movies watched.</p>
<p>Favorites:</p>

<h2>TV</h2>
<p>I don't add episodes watched here but I do actively track everything I've watched on <a href="https://trakt.tv/users/benji">trakt</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt0386676/">The Office</a> is somehow always on TV so whenever <em><strong>A</strong></em> and I don't have anything to watch and <em><strong>O</strong></em> is asleep, that goes on. There's also a lot of <a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt7678620/">Bluey</a>.</p>
<p>A few favorites from this year:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt9253284/">Andor</a></li>
<li><a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt14452776/">The Bear</a></li>
<li><a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt11000902/">Our Flag Means Death</a></li>
<li><a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt13623580/">Reservation Dogs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt11897688/">The Resort</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Rewatched</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt2543312/">Halt and Catch Fire</a></li>
<li><a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt10574236/">Station Eleven</a></li>
<li><a href="https://imdb.com/title/tt10986410/">Ted Lasso</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Music</h2>
<p>I moved from Spotify to Apple Music <a href="https://benji.dog/articles/i-want-to-leave-spotify">earlier this year</a>. One of the biggest things that I've missed is access to Spotify's Discover Weekly which makes finding music from new artists harder now. Apple's alternative has not figured me out yet or is just not even close to Spotify's.</p>
<p>Favorite new releases:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/iFaKhtlBU7A">Skinny Ape - Gorillaz</a></li>
<li><a href="https://joliette.bandcamp.com/track/contraluz">Contraluz - Joliette</a></li>
<li><a href="https://anmlcollectve.bandcamp.com/album/time-skiffs">Time Skiffs - Animal Collective</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wetleg.bandcamp.com/album/wet-leg">Wet Leg - Wet Leg</a></li>
<li><a href="https://poolkidsband.bandcamp.com/album/pool-kids">Pool Kids - Pool Kids</a></li>
<li><a href="https://weyesblood.bandcamp.com/album/and-in-the-darkness-hearts-aglow">And In The Darkness, Hearts Aglow - Weyes Blood</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I've also been enjoying figuring out what sort of stuff <em><strong>O</strong></em> likes to listen to. Whenever he reacts to music we save it and replay it later and if he reacts positvely multiple times, we add it to his playlist:</p>
<p><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/music-of-oz/pl.u-V9D7mEkiB8YL1Lg">Music of Oz</a></p>
<p>We haven't added anything new in a bit because he's currently in a <a href="https://gorillaz.com/">Gorillaz</a> only phase. I'm not complaining.</p>
<h2>Read</h2>
<p>I also haven't figured out how I want these posted on my site but I went back through what I've read and thought I'd add them here for now.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's not super obvious from this website but I like colors. I'm not comfortable working until I have a proper colorscheme that works in all the editors I use. For a little while now I've been working on <a href="https://benji.dog/articles/sylveon">Sylveon</a> and use that as my main colorscheme everywhere.</p>
<p>I still wanted a place to collect colorschemes  but there are so many beautiful colorschemes out there so I just wanted to list a few that I like and have used sorted by when I learned about them.</p>
