			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I <a href="https://www.benji.dog/articles/i-want-to-leave-spotify/">spent some time</a> considering my options and also ended up with Apple Music. I thought some of these crossplay issues were related to me using an Android phone, Chromecast, and macOS so while not great, its encouraging to know that these are also true in the ecosystem. Hopefully that means that they'll fix it sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>I do miss Spotify's curated playlists and I don't think Apple Music has played me something outside of saved artists and songs I have.</p>
<p>There are two pros that make Apple Music worth it for me in the end. The sound quality is actually noticeably better and Spatial Audio is great. Lastly, the ability to add music that I own and isn't on Apple Music or Spotify is great. I had been using Plex with Plexamp to listen to my owned library and while thats still there, its good to have everything in a single place.</p>
<p>In the end I do agree: Spotify just works. Apple Music is annoying, but it works for me.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<title>I want to leave Spotify</title>
			<link>https://benji.dog/articles/i-want-to-leave-spotify/</link>
			<description>But not really sure how</description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="img-block"><img src="https://benji.dog/uploads/1643654098_XtGdBBmDN4.png" alt="Spotify Wrapped 2021: My audio aura - My top music moods are exuberant and angst" /></span></p>
<p>Everyone is leaving Spotify. It's been something on the back of my mind for a bit but recent events have definitely made me put more thought into it. My biggest issue is that I pay for Spotify Family to get my family access to it as well. When I think of leaving a subscription service like this, I also have to figure out the migration for the less tech savvy people in my family.</p>
<p>I own quite a few albums that I host on my <a href="https://www.plex.tv/">Plex Media Server</a> and listen with <a href="https://plexamp.com/">Plexamp</a> on my phone. This works great for me and I'll continue building on this library but this doesn't really translate well for 5 other people with their own favorite artists, albums, and playlists.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/how-to-break-up-61760779">Violet Blue's guide</a> walks through the migration process from Spotify to a different platform really well. The biggest issue while trying to find where to move to is finding a platform that also works in Ecuador and the Bahamas. <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204411">Apple Music</a> is the only other service that matches the criteria I'm looking for however I'm not sure what the experience for Apple Music is like on an Android device.</p>
<p>All that being said, even though the migration process is well documented and there are multiple tools to help in that process, it seems there are quite <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2022/01/28/porting-from-spotify-to-tidal/">a few issues</a> in getting things to work. Times this by two other people I will have to help migrate stuff.</p>
<p>My options at this point are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay with Spotify</li>
<li>Switch to Apple Music and help migrate to those who need it</li>
<li>Switch to Apple Music and start from scratch</li>
</ul>
<p>Do I really need my playlist for a roadtrip in 2015?</p>
<p>Yes, I think I do.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There's a few ways to do it and I'm still trying to figure out which works best for my setup. Since Obsidian is really just reading from a local file system, you could use any number of application to sync that directory between devices. I think something like <a href="https://dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> would work but I'm thinking about going with <a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git">Obsidian Git</a> plugin would also work but there is no mobile support. On Android this can sort of be handled with <a href="https://termux.com/">Termux</a> and a cron job. The E2EE gets a little more complicated but I have this on my list of things to try:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://renerocks.ai/blog/obsidian-encrypted-github-android/">https://renerocks.ai/blog/obsidian-encrypted-github-android/</a></li>
