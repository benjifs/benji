		<summary>collecting color schemes that I like or use here</summary>
		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's not super obvious from this website but I like colors. I'm not comfortable working until I have a proper colorscheme that works in all the editors I use. For a little while now I've been working on <a href="https://benji.dog/articles/sylveon">Sylveon</a> and use that as my main colorscheme everywhere.</p>
<p>I still wanted a place to collect colorschemes  but there are so many beautiful colorschemes out there so I just wanted to list a few that I like and have used sorted by when I learned about them.</p>

		<summary>I built a micropub client</summary>
		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class="img-block"><img src="https://benji.dog/assets/images/sparkles-icon.png" alt="sparkles: a micropub client" /></span></p>
<p><strong>Update (2022-12-13)</strong>: Did some cleanup to the code so I'm feeling ok about making this public now.Code is available here: <a href="https://github.com/benjifs/sparkles">https://github.com/benjifs/sparkles</a></p>
<hr />
<p>I've been working on a <a href="https://indieweb.org/Micropub/Clients">micropub client</a> on and off for a few months now and since its <a href="https://indieweb.org/2022-12-indieweb-gift-calendar">IndieWeb Gift Calendar</a> season, I figured it was the perfect time to write about it.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> <a href="https://sparkles.sploot.com/">sparkles</a> is a micropub client. It supports <a href="https://indieauth.net/">IndieAuth</a> for login and expects a <a href="https://indieweb.org/Micropub/Servers">micropub endpoint</a> to communicate with to publish posts. It supports basic micropub content types and you can also add movies you have watched.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/benjifs/micropub">micropub and media endpoint</a> sometime in 2020 and since then I've been using several micropub clients to post content to my site. There are some extensions I would have liked to add to those but I felt like they were so specific to how I want to publish content to my site that it wouldn't have made sense to add there. I could have also just built the specific additions I wanted but I took this as an opportunity to build the one micropub client I would like to use.</p>
<h2>Development</h2>
<p>Similar to my micropub endpoint, I wanted to build this so it could easily be deployed to <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> with a single click and some minor environment variable configurations.</p>
<p>I initially tried to keep things as close to vanilla JS as possible but in the end chose to use <a href="https://mithril.js.org/">Mithril.js</a> as a framework. I already use several of the other popular Javascript frameworks in other projects so I took this as an opportunity to learn something new.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">CORS</a> errors started showing up and the quickest way I figured at the time to handle these errors was to use <a href="https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/">Netlify's functions</a> to proxy requests to the <a href="https://indieauth.net/">IndieAuth</a> and micropub endpoints. There is probably a better way to handle this but I figured this could be future Benji's problem.</p>
<h2>The Actual App</h2>
<p><span class="img-block"><img src="https://benji.dog/assets/images/sparkles-menu.jpg" alt="sparkles: main menu" /></span></p>
<p>On login there are options to add content based on the basic content types. Clicking on notes for example will open up a basic <code>textarea</code> and an input field for comma separated tags.</p>
<p><span class="img-block"><img src="https://benji.dog/assets/images/sparkles-note.jpg" alt="sparkles: adding note content" /></span></p>
<p>One of the custom content types that I wanted to support on my site is <a href="https://benji.dog/watched">watched</a> movie posts. I currently manually run some code to convert my RSS feed from <a href="https://letterboxd.com/">Letterboxd</a> and it works well enough but ideally this could all be done directly to my site using micropub. For movie search I am using <a href="https://www.omdbapi.com/">OMDb API</a> which gives me all the basic info I would want to display for a movie.</p>
<p><span class="img-block"><img src="https://benji.dog/assets/images/sparkles-movie-search.jpg" alt="sparkles: movie search" /></span></p>
<p>After a movie is selected, you can select if you have rewatched it and whether or not to rate it.</p>
<p><span class="img-block"><img src="https://benji.dog/assets/images/sparkles-movie-add.jpg" alt="sparkles: adding The Empire Strikes Back as a watched post" /></span></p>
<p>The last bit of features I wanted to add where all dependent on sparkles being a <a href="https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/">Progressive Web App (PWA)</a>. With the website installed on my phone as a PWA I could now share content from other apps to sparkles which will let me create a &quot;reply&quot;, &quot;bookmark&quot;, &quot;like&quot;, or &quot;RSVP&quot; post.</p>
<p><span class="img-block"><img src="https://benji.dog/assets/images/sparkles-share-android.jpg" alt="Android share menu" /></span></p>
<p><span class="img-block"><img src="https://benji.dog/assets/images/sparkles-share.jpg" alt="sparkles: handle share target" /></span></p>
<p>Lastly, I can also create a quick note or add an image using the <code>shortcuts</code> option.</p>
<p><span class="img-block"><img src="https://benji.dog/assets/images/sparkles-shortcuts.jpg" alt="sparkles: shortcut sample" /></span></p>
<h2>Issues</h2>
<p>PWA support is sort of iffy in my experience. I think Safari on iOS doesn't have full support for <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/shortcuts">shortcuts</a></code> or <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest/share_target">share_target</a></code> which I think makes sense since these are still marked experimental.</p>
<p>On Android, only Chrome or Samsung Browser on Samsung devices seem to have access to a <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1243583">WebAPK minting server</a> which is necessary for the full PWA experience.</p>
<p>While the website can still be added as a shortcut, it will lose those key features if its not installed with a browser that supports PWAs.</p>
<h2>Future plans</h2>
<p>The code for <a href="https://benji.dog/tags/sparkles">sparkles</a> is <s>still not open source but once I get stuff cleaned up I plan to make it public</s> now on <a href="https://github.com/benjifs/sparkles">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>I don't usually write out reviews for movies so I completely forgot to include that when building the movie editor out. I plan to add an optional <code>textarea</code> with a checkbox to mark whether or not the content itself contains a spoiler.</p>
<p>The other type of content that I wanted to be able to publish from here are recipes. I have the basic idea for how to structure them but I'm still in the early planning stages on how to handle the different parts of a recipe. I also have to add support for this type of post on my <a href="https://github.com/benjifs/micropub">micropub endpoint</a> first which is why I'm leaving all of this for later.</p>]]></content>

		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I <a href="https://www.benji.dog/articles/i-want-to-leave-spotify/">spent some time</a> considering my options and also ended up with Apple Music. I thought some of these crossplay issues were related to me using an Android phone, Chromecast, and macOS so while not great, its encouraging to know that these are also true in the ecosystem. Hopefully that means that they'll fix it sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>I do miss Spotify's curated playlists and I don't think Apple Music has played me something outside of saved artists and songs I have.</p>
<p>There are two pros that make Apple Music worth it for me in the end. The sound quality is actually noticeably better and Spatial Audio is great. Lastly, the ability to add music that I own and isn't on Apple Music or Spotify is great. I had been using Plex with Plexamp to listen to my owned library and while thats still there, its good to have everything in a single place.</p>
<p>In the end I do agree: Spotify just works. Apple Music is annoying, but it works for me.</p>]]></content>

		<summary>But not really sure how</summary>
		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span class="img-block"><img src="https://benji.dog/uploads/1643654098_XtGdBBmDN4.png" alt="Spotify Wrapped 2021: My audio aura - My top music moods are exuberant and angst" /></span></p>
<p>Everyone is leaving Spotify. It's been something on the back of my mind for a bit but recent events have definitely made me put more thought into it. My biggest issue is that I pay for Spotify Family to get my family access to it as well. When I think of leaving a subscription service like this, I also have to figure out the migration for the less tech savvy people in my family.</p>
<p>I own quite a few albums that I host on my <a href="https://www.plex.tv/">Plex Media Server</a> and listen with <a href="https://plexamp.com/">Plexamp</a> on my phone. This works great for me and I'll continue building on this library but this doesn't really translate well for 5 other people with their own favorite artists, albums, and playlists.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/how-to-break-up-61760779">Violet Blue's guide</a> walks through the migration process from Spotify to a different platform really well. The biggest issue while trying to find where to move to is finding a platform that also works in Ecuador and the Bahamas. <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204411">Apple Music</a> is the only other service that matches the criteria I'm looking for however I'm not sure what the experience for Apple Music is like on an Android device.</p>
<p>All that being said, even though the migration process is well documented and there are multiple tools to help in that process, it seems there are quite <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2022/01/28/porting-from-spotify-to-tidal/">a few issues</a> in getting things to work. Times this by two other people I will have to help migrate stuff.</p>
<p>My options at this point are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay with Spotify</li>
<li>Switch to Apple Music and help migrate to those who need it</li>
<li>Switch to Apple Music and start from scratch</li>
</ul>
<p>Do I really need my playlist for a roadtrip in 2015?</p>
<p>Yes, I think I do.</p>]]></content>
